## REST
There are three forms of rest;  
Short rests, long rests, and full rests.

If you resting would transition from one stage to the next, you only gain the benefit of the greater rest. A character can go a day with only a short rest, but will require long or full rest for any day afterwards or be subject to a level of fatigue.

A short rest provides little benefit itself, but can restore function of some special features and can prevent fatigue from marching. A short rest represents about half an hour to an hour of downtime. One can eat during this time but should not be actively engaged in any task of demand.  

A long rest allows a fed and hydrated individual to restore a hitpoint and a level of fatigue. This represents roughly 8-9 hours including sleep.

A full rest allows a fed and hydrated character to recover half of their missing hitpoints and a level of fatigue. Additionally, simply taking this rest recovers a single level of fatigue and a single hitpoint (after the benfits of being well fed and hydrated). This requires a full 24 hours of uninterrupted rest.

## LIGHT
Light comes in four levels;  
Bright, Fair, Dim, and Darkness.  
    • **Bright light** is more than most creatures are used to and confers a -1 penalty to all checks, saves, and attack rolls relying on sight made in it. Attempting to stare into the sun in the morning is comparable to bright light’s effect.  
    • **Fair light** represents the light most creatures are accustom to during the day, such as natural sunlight.   
    • **Dim light** is barely enough light for most diurnal creatures to operate by, causing a -2 penalty to all checks relying on sight and attack rolls made in it.  
    • **Darkness** puts a creature at disadvantage on all rolls relying on sight in addition to a -2 penalty.

## REACTIONS FROM OTHERS
Whenever the players encounter other people, it may be fit to determine how they react to the player. Roll a die 20 to determine the type of reaction (sometime called the "emotion" of the encounter) and a d4 is rolled to determine the intesnity. a result of 4 on the d4 makes the fellow indifferent, causing no meaningful effect.

Hostility (1-2 or 19-20)  
    1) Is not fighting outright, but will be oppositional to the party.  
    2) Not actively attacking the players, but a bad remark can change that.  
    3) Immediate Combat with the intent of doing harm to the party.

Fear (3-4 or 17-18)  
    1) Apprehensive to dealing with the party.  
    2) Will go out of their way to avoid the party.  
    3) Will attempt to avoid the party entirely, but if engaged will strike out of fear (having disadvantage) to produce an opportunity to escape.

Amicability (5-7 or 14-16)  
    1) You get "the nod" and go about your day.  
    2) You get a friendly greeting.  
    3) If it is a person, they may offer a piece of friendly advice (like "Mind the ruts ahead, they'll stop your wagon if you aren't careful"). If it is a less sapient creature, it will perform some equally freindly gesture as appropriate to the creature.

Greed (8 or 13)  
    1) They would like to offer some form of trade or other transaction.  
    2) They will demand your money and any obvious (and easily sold) goods from you.  Alternatively, they might appear to be helpful but instead lead you to a trap.  
    3) They will attack you and loot the bodies. They are very much likely to retreat if you can turn the tables on them.

Curiosity (9-11)  
    1) You get a funny look.  
    2) You get a greeting and a lot of questions.  
    3) They will begin to follow you, stealthily or otherwise.

## REPUTATION
A character with a reputation has a chance of being noticed in a social encounter when their identity is revealed. A d12 is rolled for each type of reputation held by the character. If the result is lower, they recognize the character for it.

The reaction's d20 result should be modified a number of points equal to the difference of the d12 and the reputation towards the appropriate emotion. If the result was already of the appropriate emotion, it should instead increase the intensity by one-third of the difference.

### Special Reputation
A special reputation is extremely niche and not checked for every encounter, but simply when interacting with some very particular individuals. It should be used to influence the nuance of an encounter rather than the general emotion. 

## FALLING
If a creature falls from a particular distance, they will likely receive some amount of damage in the form of force or crushing attacks (narrator's choice). If a creature lands on a particular type of object, the damage can be adjusted accordingly (a spike dealing piercing or blade cutting).

For the sake of simplicity, we’ll say all creatures are affected the same way by forces such as drag. Creatures fall roughly at a rate of 15 yards per round. Creatures with a flying speed may reduce this speed by an amount equal to their flying speed. Levitating creatures are, of course, able to stop. The severity of what is inflicted to a creature will depend on the distance traveled:  
2-3 yards = 1 club attack  
3-5 yards = 1 attack  
6-9 yards = 1 attack with a +1 bonus  
10-14 yards = 1 attack with a +2 bonus  
15-20 yards = 1 attack with a +2 bonus, then another attack  
21-25 yards = 1 attack with a +2 bonus, then another attack with a +1 bonus  
26-30 yards = 1 attack with a +3 bonus, then another attack with a +1 bonus  
31-40 yards = 1 attack with a +3 bonus, then another attack with a +2 bonus  
41-50 yards = 1 attack with a +3 bonus, then another attack with a +2 bonus, then another attack  

For every 5 yards beyond 50, add another attack.  
A character may perform an athletics check as a reaction to reduce the fall, in feet, by the total of the result. The character will be prone until the end of the next round.

### Knockback
If a creature would be knocked away by an effect, but hits an obstacle would prevent it from continuing, it will receive damage like it is falling- with the distance "fallen" being equal to the remaining knockback distance.

## CARRYING CAPACITY
Carrying capacity reflects how much weight you can wear for travel. You have 3 weight load levels- light, moderate, and heavy. Your light load is up to a number of pounds equal to your [Body] and places no effect on you. Your moderate load limit is double your [Body] in pounds and will not cause you to suffer a level of exhaustion at the end of an adventuring day if you must bear it for any lengthy duration, but will slow down your pace some. A heavy load is 2.5 pounds multiplied by your [Body]. You will suffer a level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

### Lifting
If attempting to lift an object as a skill check, the DV is 1 per 1.5 pounds of weight the object is. Certain difficult to manage items could be up to 4 per pound. Multiple individuals can contribute to this.

## FOOD, WATER, AND SURVIVAL
While rules for the cost of food on the road is given, they are only an average of the cost of eating on the road. Included herein are more detailed rules for food, drink, and deprivation of such things.

### Food
It is recommended that adventurers eat about 4 servings per day. If an adventurer is not marching the whole day or is otherwise not exerting themselves heavily, only 3 servings should be neccessary. Once a week, an adventurer could get by with only 2 servings without ill effect (aside from being a bit grumpy). A diet can consist of no more than two-thirds of one food type. A diet incorporating more than 1 serving of salted food per day can lead to health problems. An adventurer can eat up to 2 servings more per day without ill effect in general, save for a little weight gain perhaps.  
After 3 days of improper eating, the adventurer takes on a level of exhaustion. After a week, this is increased to two. Each week beyond that will incur another level of exhaustion. This exhaustion cannot be recovered by resting.

**Legumes**, $3.4 per lb.  
A shelf stable dry good. These require water or some other cooking method to take full advantage of. A single lb can provide 2.5 servings so long as another food type is consumed with it. Part of this reflects the addition of the cooking medium.

**Leafy Produce**, $4.4 per lb.  
Only good for 1d4+1 days, at which point it will become spoiling produce. These can typically be eaten as it but some varieties (such as cabbage), may be cooked. A pound will provide about 2 servings.

**Miscellaneous Produce**, $3.8 per lb.  
Only good for about 1d4+1 days, at which point it will become spoiling produce. This represents some of the more colorful vegetables that might grow in the region. A lb will provide about 2 servings.

**Onions**, $2 per lb.  
Good for 4d4+10 days. They can be prepared in a variety of methods. While most varieties are not enjoyable raw, some can be tolerable. A pound provides 1.5 or 2 servings depending on how much it is cooked. The value of onions has a surprising amount of fluctuation to it, being up to 1d20+1d12 percent above or below the listed price.

**Spoiling Produce**, $2 per lb.  
Only good for 1d2 days. Good is a generous term for this stuff. It's not completely bad, but it is more likely to carry with it the chance of bringing sickness to its consumer. If consumed for consecutive days, a [Fort] save must be made or the consumer will contract some foodborne malady. If multiple portions were consumed, each portion beyond the first brings with it an instance of disadvantage and a -1 penalty. Anything after this stage is no longer food. A pound provides 2 servings.

#### Proteins
You may only benefit from 2 total servings of protein per day. Nuts count as protein, but the value of them is included in the trade goods. A pound of shelled nuts offers 1.5 servings (shell is roughly half weight for most nuts) if consumed with another food type. Nuts still in the shell are good for a year. Shelled nuts are good for 2d4+1 months.

**Common Poultry**, $9 per lb.  
Lasts 1d2 days. Domesticated fowl. The natural flavor is fairly tame and lends itself to being manipulated by a cook well equipped with spices. A pound provides 2 servings.

**Common Steak**, $15 per lb.  
Lasts 1d3 days. Domestic cattle. A popular meat when the budget affords it. A pound provides 2 servings.

**Exotic Poultry**, $15 per lb.

**Exotic Steak**, $45 per lb.  
Lasts 1d3 days. Representing the meat of aurochs, fine game, and other exotic creatures. A pound provides 2 servings.

**Matured Cheese**, $27-51 per lb.

**Mild Cheese**, $9 per lb.  
Lasts 3d12+4 days. Most cheeses are of this variety. A pound offers 2 servings.

**Cured meat**, $5 per serving (weighs .7 lb)  
Lasts 8d6+6 weeks. The exact nature of the meat varies, but the yield is the same. Water is strongly recommended.

**Dehydrated Meat**, $7 per serving (weighs .3 lb)  
Lasts 6d6+10 days. The exact protein source varies, but the yield is the same. This meat has been dehydrated by the Dehydration spell.

#### Bread
A diet cannt consist of more than one-third bread to gain any benefit and two portions of bread does not a meal make. All forms of bread count as one type of food.

**Quick-loaf**, $1 each  
A simple loaf of bread which can contribute a single serving to the adventurer's meal. Filling enough on its own, but not the most nutritively rich food, requiring one to supplement it with other foods. Quick-loaf is good for 1d2+1 days before it becomes host to undesirable lifeforms.

**Typical Loaf**, $14 each (weighs 3 lb)
A loaf of bread which provides 6 total servings. It lasts 1d4 days before going bad, but gets hard after 1d2 days. A hard loaf can be softened with soup or sauce.

#### Starch
An adventurer's diet can compose of no more than one-third starch to gain any benefit from it. All forms of starch count as the same type of food.

**Rice**, $1.3 per lb.  
A shelf stable dry good. Requires a cooking medium such as water to use effectively. A single pound provides 2 servings, but only if another food type is available.

**Potatoes**, $1.1 per lb.  
Good for 1d8+4 days. A pound of potatoes can provide 2 portions once cooked.

#### Fruit
The price of fruit may be higher if they are not grown locally.

**Apricots**, $2.3 per lb.  
They last 1d3+2 days and offer 2 servings to the pound.

**Blueberries**, $4.75 per lb.  
These little guys last 1d3 days. A pound provides 2 servings. They are a popular choice for the production of wine in the lazine empire.

**Cane Berries**, $8 per lb.  
Includes the likes of blackberries, raspberries, and so on. Lasts 1d2 days. A pound provides 2 servings.

**Dates**, $43 per lb.
Last 2d4+3 weeks. A pound provides 2 servings.

**Lemons**, $50 per lb.
Lasts 1d4+3 days. Not typically eaten as a food stuff, even a portion of a serving can help keep adventurers healthier by maintaining vitamin C levels and also functioning as an astringent. The narrator may find some minor benefit to confer the adventurers for these.

**Malorberries**, $66 per lb.
Lasts 1d2 days. A cultivar of mulberry which has the unique property of _reducing the -1 penalty to [Fort] save brought on by potions. This lasts for 1d20+5 minutes after consuming a serving_. A pound provides 1.5 servings.

### Hydration and Drinking
Everyone needs to stay hydrated. Casual hydration will be 8 servings. Full adventuring will be 12-14. As a rough guide, 1 cup of water is a serving of water.

For those with access to water, it is typically free. Even cities often have free access fountains or wells. Whether or not it is pleasent to drink can be contested. A glass vial of water can be purchased for $45 and holds 2 servings of water.

**Ale**, $1.6 per quart  
Lasts 10d10+10 days if unopened. Lasts a day once opened. You can drink up to two servings of ale without major effect other than providing fluid appropriately. Each serving of ale provides 2 points of inebriation. A quart provides 3 servings.

**Table Wine**, $10  
A common wine to have with dinner for those living above the poverty line. This 750 ml bottle provides 5 servings. Each serving provides 2 points of inebriation. One could hypothetically down the whole bottle to gain a serving of fluid, but could only beneift from a single bottle of wine this way. This can be found in terracotta like a potion, or glass (with a cork) for an additional $20 charge.

**Fair Wine**, $35 per bottle  
Consumed by the poor on special occasion and the wealthy when they feel like it. This bottle provides 6 servings, each of which produces 3 points of inebriation. If you drank the entire bottle, you would receive a single point of fluid if you had not already drank a bottle of wine. Can be found in a glass bottle.

**Fine Wine**, $5d20+5d12+35 per bottle  
A higher quality wine. Each bottle provides 6 servings. Each of this bottle's servings is going to bless you with 3 points of inebriation. You will not find a whole serving of fluid in this bottle as it will make you epel as much as you could gain.

**Milk**, $1.15 per quart  
Once per day, a serving of milk can contribute both a serving of food and a serving of fluid. A quart provides four servings.

**Sorcha**, $32 per quart  
A traditional spirit infused with peppercorns, cardamum, anise, fennel, and lemon peel. It is robust but has a little bite to it. A quart contains 12 servings, which are each capable of giving a character 3 points of enebriation. A character gains no hydration from this and will infact require an additional serving of water for every 4 servings they partake in.

**Stout**, $2.25 per quart  
Lasts 12d12+40 days if unopened. Lasts a day once opened. You can drink a single serving of stout without major effect other than providing fluid appropriately. Each serving of stout provides 3 points of inebriation. A quart provides 3 servings.

### INEBRIATION
Characters are likely going to drink. Even if they don't, some substances can create similarly debilitating effects to alcohol. Each point of inebriation can last for 1d12 + 1d8 minutes. This is individual to each point of inebriation. When the time expires from the inebriation point, each die is reduced by 1 level each. Once a die is reduced below 1, it is no longer rolled. When both dice are lost from the inebriation, that point of inebriation is lost.  
A point of inebriation does not begin for a number of minutes equal to your [Fort].  
When your inebriation reachs half of your [Fort], you are obtunded. When your inebriation is 3/4 of your [Fort], you are stuporous. When your inebriation reaches your [Fort], you are incapacitated.
