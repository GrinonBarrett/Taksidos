### MOUNTS
Mounts are living creatures domesticated for uses including riding and draughtwork. Anytime the mount would be startled or tasked to do something it wouldn’t normally do, an Animal Empathy check is required. A failure results in the mount’s refusal. A critical failure results in the mount bucking against the handler. If the handler was riding, they may attempt a [Rflx] save to remain mounted or to land in a safe manner. On a failure, the handler is knocked off the mount, knocked prone, and an unarmed attack is inflicted upon the rider.

#### HANDS AND MANIPULATORS
Unless otherwise noted, mounts are not considered to have "hands".

#### WEIGHT LOADS
The weight loads for mounts is determined per mount instead of using the standard formulae.

#### TRAMPLING
Mounts can trample creatures up to the same size, so long as they are not a mount themselves or capable of trampling as a mount.

#### BUMPY RIDES
When attempting to perform an attack while mounted, you will have to deal with penalties. Divide the numbar of yards moved in total since the beginning of the same phase of the previous round by your most appropriate movement speed. This is your penalty to your attack. 
A proper cavalry weapon being used to make an attack has this total penalty reduced by half.
You also suffer a -2 penalty to all attacks made while mounted if you are not proficient with Riding.

#### DEATH DRAGGING
Sometimes, one gets dragged by a tether. They may be caught in a restraint and dragged by a mount or perhaps being willfully dragged by another. They must succeed a [Rflx] save with a DV equal to the feet traveled or lose 1 hitpoint. If one being dragged has no remaining hitpoints, it must make an incapacitation save. The narrator may asses a specific damage type as appropriate to the terrain.

#### MOUNT HUNGER AND THIRST
A mount is subject to hunger and thirst just as adventurerers, but usually have greater needs in their diet. As such, the total amount of feed and water required varies by the creature's size.
