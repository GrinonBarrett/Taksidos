### Draftsnail
An extremely uncommon sight anywhere else, draftsnails are a vital part of the Lazine empire. They are more docile than horses, require less feed, and are fairly stout for their size. Unlike most snails, draftsnails do not have eyestalks but two pairs of eyes, one forward and the other to the sides. This technically gives them a wide field of view, but does not grant any benefit to the actual detail of vision itself.

**Draftsnail Subsistance**: The draftsnail requires half as much food as a normal mount, but requires triple the fluids to remain healthy.

**Shelled Form**: A draftsnail cannot be armored.

**Tuck in Shell**: A draftsnail may retreat into (or come out of) its shell as an action. While in its shell, the draftsnail is considered prone. Additionally, its defense is improved as noted above. Furthermore, the only wounds which may be dealt to it are biased wounds. If it has no such wounds options remaining, it is no longer limited to only receiving biased wounds.

**Mucous**: The body of a draftsnail is coated in a  mucous which is constantly being produced.  
 • Anytime it would need to make a [Fort] or [Rflx] save as a result of a fluid it is submerged in, it gains advantage on that save.  
 • It may spend a minute coating specific points of a surface in its mucous manually to grant itself a +2 bonus to checks/saves pertaining to climbing or retaining your balance on that surface. Any creature which does not have the Mucous feature which crosses the path has a -2 penalty to such checks/saves unless they allow the mucous to dissipate which does so after a minute in normal air or water.  
 • Any tack or harness for the draftsnail needs to be designed for it.

**Draftsnail Resilience**: Draftsnails are not killed by massive damage.
