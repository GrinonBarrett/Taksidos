### AIRCRAFT

#### Impacts
For the purpose of this document, treat impacts with aircraft as landrunners crashing. Note that this can cause an aircraft to stall.

#### Stall speeds
Several creatures and vehicles capable of flight have a stall speed. If the creature cannot fly the total distance required to satisfy their stall speed during the round, they will fall.
