### LANDRUNNERS
Landrunners are land based vehicles. Some are drawn by animals, others are powered by some other means.

#### DRAWING
A drawn landrunner is pulled by a domesticated animal. Anytime the animal would be startled or tasked to do something it wouldn’t normally do, an Animal Empathy check is required. A failure results in the animal’s refusal. A critical failure results in the animal bucking against the handler. If the handler was riding, they may attempt a [Rflx] save to remain mounted or to land in a safe manner. On a failure, the handler is knocked off the cart and knocked prone.

#### DRAFTWORK
For the purpose of drawing a landrunner, a creature's weight capacity is doubled.

#### HIT-AND-RUN
A hit-and-run occurs when a landrunner moves to engage a smaller foe and is done in place of a brawl. To determine the effects of a hit and run, total the weight in stones. Multiply that by the mean of the total yards traveled by the landrunner in the last 3 rounds. Divide this by the Body + the weight in stones of the hit creature to determine the number of force attacks by the landrunner. If the result would be less than 1, no damage is dealt and the landrunner stops. A number of force attacks is inflicted equal to the number of yards it traveled in the previous round + the number of meters it was supposed to travel but prevented from doing so as a result of the stoppage. 

#### CRASHING
When a landrunner collides with another object each object will be dealt damage. The damage received is calculated independently for each object/landrunner. The object being dealt damage is the collidee, and the other object is the collider. Take the collider's weight in stones and divide by the collidee's weight in stones. Multiply this by the mean of both of the yards traveled by the collidee in the previous 3 rounds and the mean of the meters moved in the collider's previous 3 rounds. The narrator may adjust this by up to half depending on the direction the collider was headed.
