**Fleet Foot**: During the first round of an encounter, the caui may use its action to perform a move.

**Swift Step**: If the caui would gain exhaustion for sprinting because it ran, it may choose simply not to. It must complete a rest before doing so again.

**Skiddish**: It suffers disadvantage on saves against fear effects, but gains an additional reaction each round it is affected by a fear effect.

**Extensive Breeding**: Caui have seen some success when selectively bred to have genetic advantages when performing certain tasks. All caui fall under a single breed type. The caui gains benefits based on the breed type.
