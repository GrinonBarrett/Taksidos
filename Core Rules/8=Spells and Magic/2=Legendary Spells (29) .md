Legendary spells are named for their creator. These spells are listed by creator rather than letter. Legendary spells cannot simply be learned by a character. The creators' notes are often lost or buried and require deciphering. Alternatively, if such a magician is still alive, direct tutalege could allow a character to learn such a spell.

#### Alekard's Blood Barrage

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 25 yards

**Effect**: You inflict a necrotic attack against a foe within range, opening up some form of wound in their flesh if successful. In place of damaging armor, this attack inflicts hemorrhaging. Instead of rolling for the wound's effect, it lowers the maximum hitpoints of the creature by 1 until it is healed. If the foe is hemorrhaging (either as a result of this spell or a preexisting condition), you manipulate some of their blood and transmute it into up to 3 projectiles which may be hurled at a different target within a number of yards equal to the tier of this spell to inflict a club attack. Each of these attacks, if a critical hit, can be treated as one of the following attack types (acid, cold, fire, necrotic).

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum can grant one of the club attacks attack a +1 bonus or increase the number of club attacks by 1, in addition to the benefits noted above.

If the intial (necrotic) attack is a critical hit, you may inflict a level of exhasution against the foe. If they receive exhaustion this way, you recover a level of exhaustion.

On a critical success, you may alter the damage type of the initial attack to be radiant or fire.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum can grant the initial attack a +1 bonus or increase the explosion radius by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: You have offended Alekard in some way. You are subject to a necrotic attack, fire attack, and radiant attack. For each of these attacks, you may choose to take on a level of fatigue to ignore the attack before it is rolled.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to produce the blast, suffering spells sickness equal to the spell's tier -1.

#### Alekora's Screech

**Effect**: You fling a weighty, squishy, orb. Upon impact, it explodes to inflict an acid attack against anything 1 yard of the impact point. On a critical hit, this inflicts the effect of a ki critical hit instead of an acid effect, and then either a necrotic critical hit or a radiant critical hit (your choice). In its trajectory, you may have it rotate 30 degrees at any point.

A critical success with the spell check allows you to increase the rotation to 45 degeres or to have a second rotaion, with the first performed within the first 10 and the second performed within the last 10 yards.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum grants the attacks a +1 for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit.

**Minimum Tier**: 5

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Effect**: You touch a creature to inject unhallowed surges of deathly energy, inflicting a Necrotic attack. Instead of inflicting a typical wound, it must succeed an incapacitation save- with the DV being replaced with the attack roll result. This is in addition to the standard incapacitation save, if any. If the attack is a critical success, it inflicts another such necrotic attack as dictated to cause the typical incapacitation save as a wound. This continues for each critical hit incurred. A creature killed as a result of this spel has its head (or similar organ space) explode entirely and cannot be reanimated.

If an attack would qualify to damage armor, it instead leaves the foe vulnerable until the end of the next round.

If the spellcheck was a critical hit, any atacks made by this spell get a bonus equal to your [Magic] bonus for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit.

This cannot affect constructs, eldritch, elementals, ephemera, or fiends. Undead that would be affected by this ignore any even numbered attack results.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum grants the initial attack (but no further attacks) a +1 bonus for the purpose of determining a critical hit.

**Minimum Tier**: 5

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Effect**: You speak foul words which can manifest fetid wounds against a foe's flesh. Target foe within range suffers a necrotic attack. This has disadvantage against a creature that cannot hear you and the spell does not work if you cannot express the words (or equivalent sounds). The foe need not understand the words to be subject to them. Regardless of whether the attack was succesful or not, an affected creature must succeed an incapacitation save with a DV equal to the attack roll total. If the afflicted dies as a result of this spell in any way, it returns as an Aetherkin under the full command of the spell's caster. If it had the ability to perfrom wyrdings, it retains this ability.

This spell cannot affect Construct, Eldritch, Elemental, Ephemera, Fey, Fiend, or Undead creatures.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum increases the range by 5 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You are instead subject to the spell, with the attack gaining a bonus against you equal. If killed by the spell, you become a Aetherkin unless you were of a creature type which cannot be affected. If so, inflict a number of unlisted attacks against yourself equal to the spell's tier. For each successful attack, you gain a point of spell sickness. For each failed attack, you gain an instance of Archeblight.

These extra actions are not a part of the actual casting, but are done before the portal in question is opened of course. This spell does not set off magical alarms of a lower tier than this spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: The spell can undo a magical lock of a spell whose tier is less than half of this spell's.

**Critical Failure**: You have jammed the portal in such a way that it cannot function as you intended when casting the spell (opening or closing). If you sought to undo any locks or barres, they are instead fixed shut by the spell and vice versa. This last for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure times the spell's tier. Additionally, you have set off any magical alarms set to the portal. To make things worse, you seem to be effected as though an identical alarm (or alarms) had been set to you.

Failure on the save does not harm the creature in anyway, but a critical failure prevents the creature from having its hitpoints or wounds restored by spells from the same caster of an equal or lower tier in the same day.

**At Higher Tiers**: For every tier beyond minimum, the save is made with a +1 bonus.

You may concentrate on this spell for a number of rounds equal to the spell check's points of success.

Any creature in the area of the jet at the end of a movement phase suffers a fire attack with a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit.

In place of damaging armor, you may choose to have the orb explode. If you do, the attack gains a bonus for the purpose of inlicting a critical hit equal to the spell's tier. The orb is then destroyed.

For a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier, as long as you concentrate on the spell, you may choose to use your reaction to cause an identical explosion in the same point as the original. You may only do so once.

When the spell explodes, you may choose to inflict knockback (in feet) up to the spell's points of success + your [Magic] bonus. This is divded by the weight in stones of anything affected.

Upon impact, the sphere explodes causing anything within 4 yards to be subject to the explosion. The explosion will inflict an electric attack aginst whatever it impacted with and the resulting explosion will inflict an electrical attack against anything within the blast (including what it impacted with).
