Basic spells are those that a newer player could be exposed to knowing. Anytime a class or species' feature allows a character to gain a spell, it should be selected from this list. 

### A (12

#### Abatis

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You cause a number of trees or rocks within range to fall in such a way as to provide barriers that feature protrusions up to 2 feet in front of you (or enough to block about 1/3 of your form), with the barrier itself being dependant upon the materials. Any large or larger creature, or medium or larger mount, moving into contact with the barrier is subject to a piercing attack and must succeed either a [Body] or [Rflx] save (their choice) or be stopped. If a [Body] save is failed this way, treat the creature as impacting against the barrier, receiving knockback damage as though the remainder of the distance it was traveling was the knockback distance. If a [Rflx] save is failed this way, the creature is knocked prone.  
This barrier lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell check's points of success multiplied by the spell's tier.

If the caster is larger or smaller than Medium, adjust the size of the barrier accordingly.

The DV of the save is equal to double the spell's tier + the number of size classes above diminutive of the caster + the spell-check's points of success.

**At Higher Tiers**: As seen above, a higher tier provides several benefits.

**Critical Failure**: The barriers fall on you, inflicting a Force attack, Crushing attack, and Piercing attack- each with a bonus equal to the spell's tier. The barrier is created, of course, and lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1d12 + spell tier.

#### Abaxiate

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 3 yards

**Duration**: 3 rounds

**Effect**: You hold this spell for its duration, during which you may use your reaction in response to an object or creature moving (before knowing what direction it plans to move in) to designate a new direction for it to move. If it is not phsyically possible for it to move in that direction with its chosen mode of movement, the movement is treated as knockback movement.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the range by 1 yard and duration by 1 round.

**Critical Failure**: You instead affect yourself with the spell. If you had already targeted yourself, you instead fail to move.

#### Ablative Guard

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting TIme**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to a non-magical attack against yourself

**Effect**: You gain a bonus to defense against that attack equal to the lowest of the spell's tier or your [Magic] bonus as a magical field of force projects from yourself and covering the entirety of the direction. The forcefield then continues to exist for a total number of phases equal to the spell's tier. Magical attacks bypass the barrier completely and reduce its lifespan by 1 phase. Critical hits cause the forcefield to dissipate automatically. Fire attacks of any nature will destroy the barrier before affecting the caster.

**At Higher Tiers**: The benefits for higher tiers are noted above.

**Critical Failure**: You gain 1d4 points of spell sickness.

#### Abnegate

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You attempt to counter a spell being cast, as though you knew the spell, so long as it half the tier or lower than this spell. You must still perform a counterspell check. The foe gains a bonus to their check equal to their spell's tier and you gain a bonus equal to this spell's tier.
If you critcally fail your counterspell check, you cannot affect the spell with another abnegation of the same or lower tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: As seen above, a higher tier provides several benefits.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to counter the spell and infact have strengthened the caster against further counterspells equal to the difference in tier of this spell and their own.

#### Absend

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You cause an object to return to the relative position it occupied up to a number of minutes ago equal to the tier of the spell. A creature can be targeted by this spell, but is instead returned a point occupied measured in rounds not minutes. A creature affected by this must make a [Rflx] save or become prone or vulnerable (their choice, if they are already affected by one, they must choose the other). You may choose to grant that creature a bonus to its save equal to your [Magic] bonus.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier above minimum increases the range by 1 yard and the casting time by 1 action.

**Critical Failure**: You accidentally are affected by this spell instead. Additionally, as a result of the spell, you must succeed a [Fort] save or be Obtunded for a number of rounds equal to the tier of the spell.

#### Absenting

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to moving

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You instantly disappear. After 1d12 rounds, you move to a point in range of your choosing.

**At Higher Tiers**: When cast beyond minimum tier, the range is increased by 3 yards for each tier beyond minimum.

#### Alacering

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to rolling for initiative

**Effect**: You move a number of yards up to the spell's tier or a number of feet equal to the points of success. If you choose to move based on the spell's tier and ths spellcheck is a critical success, you may move an additional number of yards equal to your [Magic] bonus.

**At Higher Tiers**: Other than the above listed benefit, for each tier beyond minimum, the distance you move if basing the distance on the spell check result is increased by 1d4+1 feet.

**Critical Failure**: You trip and fall while spped, you are knocked back (in the direction you were facing) a number of feet equal to the points of failure multiplied by the spell's tier.

#### Alarum

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 5 minutes or more

**Range**: 60 yards

**Effect**: You magically mark a set point, up to 1 square foot, or a single portal (such as a door, window, or the opening of a container) you touch to produce stimuli of one of the five basic senses which can be perceived by anything within range. In the case of a specific point, it is disturbed if something comes in contact with it. In the case of a portal, it is disturbed if opened or closed.

So long as a creature has use of the selected sense and there is no obstruction to the stimuli, any creature within the tange will detect the stimuli.

This spell lasts a number of hours equal to the points of success (minimum of 1) multiplied by the total number of minutes spent casting the spell.

Once the alarum has been triggered, you may return it to its passive state as an action by taking on a point of spell-sickness. Another caster may try to do so as an action by performing a Spellcraft chrck with a DV equal to quadruple the spell's tier + your [Magic] bonus. The time spent "activated" still counts against the lifespan of the alarum.

**At Higher Tiers**: If cast as second tier or beyond, may produce stimuli of mulitple basic senses up to the tier of the spell, but the range is divided by the total number of senses for which stimuli is produced. Each tier beyond 1st also increases the range of the spell by 10 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You seem to have set the alarum just fine. The alarum is just as likely to randomly trigger as it is not to trigger when disturbed at all.

#### Aldervalder

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a spirit of nature to strike a foe within range, treat as a biting attack. The spirit ceases to be after a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier +1 and can be redirected against a new foe as areaction. If no new target is chosen, it will inflict a bite against the same foe at the end of the secondary action phase.

As a reaction, it can be directed at a creature which is missing hitpoints. It must succeed an incapacitation save. If successful to any degree, the creature recovers a hitpoint. A failure yields no negative consequences. The spirt ceases to exist upon such an attempt. It may only recover a hitpoint lost while the spirit existed.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 2 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The spirit conjured is quite upset with you. It grapples you for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. You cannot fight against this. During the primary action phase while you are grappled, it inflicts a biting attack against you. You are prone during this time.

#### Animation

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 3 yards

**Effect**: You grant a magical form of movement to an object as appropriate to the object. Toy soldiers march for a few seconds, a broom can sweep a section of floor, marbles roll away, a pan can flip and stir, diningware can stack or be set across the table, etc.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the casting time is increased. It will be a number of actions equal to the tier squared. At certain tiers it can create a creature as a result of its usage. This is not recommended for anyone to do.

**Critical Failure**: If you cast it in its traditional manner, you create a comical moment from your ineptitude. If you used this spell to create a creature, things will be much worse.

#### Arc Lightning

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 15 yards

**Effect**: You invoke a bolt of lightning to strike a foe within range. If the attack would damage the foe's armor or be a critical hit, it arcs to hit the nearest creature.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the range is increased by 15 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to ground yourself properly. The spell functions as normal, but attacks you as the original target.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may either reduce the casting time by 1 action (to a minimum of 1) or the range by 15 yards. Alternatively, you may devote some of the additional tiers to creating a larger Artificicheir (per that creature's description).

**Critical Failure**: You fail to properly manifest the forcefield, leaving yourself prone and vulnerable for a number of rounds equal to the tier of the spell.

### B (6

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 1 foot + a number of feet equal to the spellcheck's points of success.

**Effect**: You utter an implication to another creature which is no longer than a single sentence. If it understands, it must succeed a [Will] save or follow through with the suggestion.

This cannot be something that would cause great harm or violate one's moral tenets. Additionally, you may only target a playable species (at narrator's discretion) or a creature of the same creature type as yourself with this spell. You cannot target a creature of undeath unless you are also a creature of undeath.

**Range**: 7 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a bolt of lightning against a target within range. It, and everything in a straight line to it, are subject to an electrical attack.

The target is knocked back directly, anything else may choose to be knocked back away from you or away from the path of the lightning. During consecutive phases, in place of moving or performing an action, you may launch a follow-up bolt against the same target as part of this spell's effect. You may do this until one of the following occurs:  
• The target leaves the range of the spell.  
• The spell's attack fails to hit.  
• You perform a reaction.  
• You move.  
• The total number of phases exceeds the tier of the spell.

If an attack is a critical failure, the spell inflicts an electrical attack against you.

**Range**: 2 yards

**Effect**: The leaping creature leaps in the same general direction, but traverses triple the distance they would otherwise.

**Critical Failure**: You instead affect inflict kinetic shock against yourself. You are harmed exactly as though you feel a number of feet equal to the points of failure multiplied by the tier of the spell despite not moving. If you cast it in response to your own leaping, you immediately fall.

The fog may move slowly, with a number of square feet receeding up to the tier + spellcheck's points of success, with it spreading out elsewhere an equal number of square feet. This movement requires the caster maintain concentration on it. The fog does not need to conform to a standard shape, so long as it is contiguous. At the end of each round, after it has inflicted attacks, it will lose a number of square feet equal to its tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the square footage by 50 and the range by [Magic] yards.

**Critical Failure**: You instead create an area of fog centered on you which extends out a number of feet from you equal to the spell tier.

During the same phase of the following round, if a creature had their hitpoint recovery prevented this way, it must make an incapacitation save.

A magical effect which would heal a wound appears to heal the wound, until the same phase of the following round.

If a creature performs an incapacitation save and the die result is odd, it loses 1 hitpoint if it has any.

Effects that restore points of undeath from within the field or affecting a target within the field have the total points recovered halved (round down).

* Prevent combustion in the area.
* Move it up to a number of feet equal to the points of success.

**Effect**: You cast a recitation which is expressed in low, earth-shaking, tones. Everything within range is subject to a sonic attack. Additionally, every creature in range which could hear you must succeed a [Fort] save or be dazed until the end of the next phase. At the end of the phase, you may decide to continue performing the same recitation to continue the effect. This requires a spellcheck as normal, but suffers a -1 cumulative penalty for each phase you have continued this. This consumes the whole of your activity for the phase and you cannot take reactions while doing so. The attack and save occur again during each phase this is continued. Additionally, the range of the spell is increased by 1 yard after each phase.
You cannot be affected by another's Deep Chant of lower level while reciting your own.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the original extends the range by 1 yard.

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting TIme**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to a projectile attack against yourself

**Effect**: You gain a bonus to defense against that attack equal to the lowest of the spell's tier as a web of glowing particles forms a screen between yourself and the projectile. If the attack is a critical failure, the projectile ceases to exist. This cannot affect a magical projectile unless the spell check is a critical success.

Note that as it only affects projectiles, meaning rays are unaffected by the spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: The benefits for higher tiers are noted above.

If it has been affected by a 1st tier spell, or a source determined to be equivalent by the narrator, the effect is supressed for this spell's duration. 

If such a magic's tier would be less than half of this spell's, there is also a percentage chance that the magic is disrupted to the point that it no longer functions (though can be "repaired" by certain means). This is equal to this spell's tier plus the points of success on the spellcheck.

When used against a forcefield created by a spell of less than half of this spell's tier, that forcefield is destroyed.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may increase the time it is surpressed by 1d4 minutes or have the spell affect a magic of one tier higher.

A creature will only retain the information for a number of rounds equal to its [Inte] score times the spell-checks points of success.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the total capacity for learning the creature gains is increased to the tier of the spell.

**Critical Failure**: You cause the creature to become overwhlemed by the raw eidetic stimuli you send it, causing a psychic attack against it. If the psychic attack is a critical failure, you become subject to a psychic attack which gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier.

#### Empathic Ward

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 10 actions

**Duration**: 30 Minutes

**Effect**: You touch a creature to allow its natural humanity manifest as a shimmering veil around it.

As a reaction, it can be directed against another foe, inflicting the biting attack. Each round, during the primary action phase, it will attack the creature it is constricting with a crushing attack.

While constricting a foe, treat as a grapple with the following exception. Your value is equal to the spell check result + spell tier. The grappled target cannot use [Rflx] to escape. A critical success breaks the grasp of the ertvalder, preventing it from constricting the target for the remainder of the round.

The spirit is capable of moving through sand, dirt, and stone unimpeded. The spirit ceases to be after a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier +1.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 2 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The spirit conjured is quite upset with you. It grapples you for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. You cannot fight against this.

You are prone during this time.

#### Everwarmth

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 6 actions

**Duration**: 4 hours

**Effect**: Your touch bestows a creature the ability to maintain a body temperature which is most comfortable to them.

It also grants a +1 bonus to defense against fire and cold attacks so long as they creature wishes to have that bonus against such an attack.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may either affect an additional creature which is touching yourself or another affected by the spell or you may extend the duration by 2 hours.

**Critical Failure**: You have failed to create the magical filed that properly balances thermal regulation. Roll an attack roll against yourself. If odd, it is a crushing attack. If even, it is a cold attack.

#### Exploding Sphere

**Minimum Tier**: 4

**Casting Time**: 4 rounds

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You produce a sphere of ice, 1 foot in diameter, which is then directed in a straight line to a point you designate within range. Upon impact, the sphere explodes causing anything within 3 yards to be subject to the explosion. The explosion will, in order; perform a slashing attack, a piercing attack, and a cold attack against anything caught.

**Casting Time**: 3 rounds

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You create a 3 yard sphere centered on a point within range. All creatures and loose objects within the sphere are knocked back a number of feet equal to the spellcheck result divide by their weight in stones. You may then concentrate on the sphere to keep it in effect. Any creature or object which attempts to enter the sphere is subject to its effect. This also prevents any ranged non-magical attack from entering. Magical projectiles and the rays of magical effects are unaffected by this sphere. As is light, sound, and magical fields.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases range by 2 yards and the sphere's size by 1 yard.

You may psychically move this flame during each movement phase up to a number of yards equal to the spell's tier. You may also use your reaction to move the spell a number of yards equal to the tier + your [Magic] bonus. The flame must remain in range of you or cease to exist.

The flame is not automatically snuffed out by water or other liquids so long as it does not spend two consecutive rounds engulfed by it. It will flicker (causing it to only produce dim light for the entirety of its range). It cannot move while engulfed by the liquid.

If the flame is directed into an object or creature, it inflicts a cold attack which treats a critical hit like a fire attack, and is snuffed out.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 2 yards.

This flare produces bright out 1 yard, fair light out 2 yards from there, and dim light 2 yards beyond that. If fired at a foe, it inflicts a radiant attack. Instead of inflicting a wound- it simply adheres to that creature. If the attack would qualify to damage a foe's armor, even if they wear none, instead blind the foe for a number of rounds equal to the attack roll total. A critical hit still inflicts the the usual result.

These flares last 15 minutes

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to either increase the maximum number of missiles by 1, increase the range by 5 yards, or increase the durations by a number of minutes equal to 10 + [magic] bonus. Additionally, for every 2 tiers above minimum, you may launch an additional flare.

**Critical Failure**: You produce a flare, but it automatically sticks to you. When this occurs, it inflicts a proper radiant attack against you, with a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.

[Flare Spell]: # " Created at the request of Michael Hasty, who wanted a spell that produced 'missiles of light' which 'could blind'. What he wanted was a utility spell that could also have some use in a fight if a player thought to use it that way."

**Casting Time**: 1 Action

**Effect**: You hold your hand out, producing a sphere of light. This produces bright light out for 1 foot, fair light out to 3 yards, and dim light another 2 yards beyond that.

At the end of each round, if it is wrapped around a foe or object, it inflicts a fire attack against it.

If a creature covered in the glitter brawls with, tramples, or is trampled by another creature- that creature also finds some of the shiny dust on themself (suffering the proper penalties). Radiant attacks moving through the cloud of powder have disadvantage. Illusory magics caused by spells of a tier less than half of this spell's has its nature exposed by the dust.

Hypothetically, 5 whole minutes of fully submerged washing could preemtively dissolve the powder before its natural expiration.

A critical failure's effects are determined by the narrator.

If slamming a foe, treat as a normal slam with the following exceptions. Your value is equal to the spell check result + spell tier + [magic] bonus.

• When the effect occurs, and anytime a creature's movement is performed through the sphere, a [Rflx] save must made or the creature is made prone as it slips and fumbles through the air. It remains prone until the end of the round or it leaves the area. A critical failure results in it also being vulnerable.  
• One's effective fall distance is halved.

Once this effect ends, the power of gravity becomes intensified until the end of the next round, causing the following;

• Jump distances are halved.  
• Climb and fly speeds are halved.

 • _Thermal Resistance_. You may choose to have either Cold or Fire attacks have disadvantage against the creature. If you do, attacks of the other type gain advantage against it.  
 • _Weight capacity_. You may choose to increase the weight limits of the creature by half at each load level.  
 • _Conductivity_. You may choose to have electric attacks gain advantage or disadvantage against the creature. You may also choose to apply neither.  
 • _Appearance_. You choose the sheen of the metal.  
Once these decisions are made, they can't be changed.

After the spell ends, for a number of hours equal to the total minutes of duration, the affeted creature has a -1 penalty to all [Body] and [Fort] checks/saves and a -1 penalty to all attacks.

A creature may make a [Fort] save to avoid this if they wish.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the duration in minutes is increased. The total duration will be the tier squared.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to transfer the transmutation properly. You gain the benefits of the spell normally until the end of the next round, at which point the metal skin then begins to corrode. At the start of each round, for the remainder of the duration, you must succeed a [Fort] save or become prone for the rest of the spell's duration. Once rusted, it provides protection only like maile.

#### Isevalder

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 6 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a mist tailed spirit of nature to strike a foe within range, treat as a biting attack. If the attack would qualify to damage the foe's armor, it instead freezes the foe for half as many rounds as the spell's tier. As a reaction, it can be directed against another foe, inflicting the biting attack. Each round, during the primary action phase, it will attack the creature it was last designated to target with a cold attack.

The spirit ceases to be after a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 2 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The spirit conjured is quite upset with you. It grapples you for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. You cannot fight against this. During the primary action phase while you are grappled, it inflicts a biting attack against you. During the secondary action phase of each such round, it inflicts a cold attack. You are prone during this time.

### J (1

#### Jinx

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 1 yard

**Effect**: You have influenced some force affecting the target, giving them the worst luck possible. Inflict an undamaging attack against the foe. If successful, the suffer a penalty to all saves, checks, and attack rolls for the purpose of determining if any failure is actually a critical failure equal to the tier of this spell. This lasts for an hour. Each time this causes a critical failure, the penalty is reduced by 1.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum can eiter increases the range by 3 yards or the duration by 1 hour, in addition to the benefit noted above.

**Critical Failure**: You find yourself the subject of misfortune, as the spell affects you instead.

### K (1

#### Kiss of Death

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Effect**: You transfer to the victim of your touch a surge of deathly menace. You are prone and vulnerable while casting this spell. Upon kissing the target, it must perform an incapacitation save. 

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum increases the DV of the incapacitation save by 1 and the casting time by one action.

**Critical Failure**: You find yourself subject to the forces of the kiss instead, even if you are normally unaffected by incapacitation saves.

### L (3

#### Landing

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take before you would impact with a surface you can perceive while falling or being knocked back

**Range** 3 yards

**Effect**: You mangae to divert some of the force of your impact. Divide the feet you travled as a result of the fall or knockback by the number of other creatures within range. Then apply falling/knockback damage to each creature within range as though all were affected by it. If no other creatures were within range, you simply reduce your fall distance by number of yards equal to the spell's tier + your [Magic] bonus.

A critical success with the spell check will allow you to modify the distance applied to you (after any division of distance) by a number of feet equal to the points of success. 

Alternatively, you could cast this spell in anticpation of coming in contact with a creature travelling as a result of falling/knockback. If you do, and it would be reasonable to assume that you make contact, treat it as the subject of the spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to modify the range of the spell by 1 per tier beyond 2nd.

**Critical Failure**: You instead increase the effect distance of your fall/knockback, in feet, by the points of failure multiplied by the spell's tier. If you cast it on another creature, it is protected from the fall/knockback damage, and you take it instead- including the aforementiond penalty for critically failing the spell check.

#### Lava Axe

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 yards

**Effect**: You create a molten shape, vaguely resembling a throwing axe, which is then hurled at a foe. This inflicts a fire attack against the target. In place of inflicting a normal critical hit effect, the foe's armor receives 2 damage. If the foe is unarmored, it inflicts the traditional critical hit effect.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum sees the attack gain a +1 bonus.

**Critical Failure**: The axe explodes infront of you, inflicting the effect against you instead.

#### Levitation

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 rounds

**Duration** Spell tier minutes multiplied by spell tier

**Effect**: A creature you touch may defy physics by gaining a hover speed of 3 yards for the duration. If the spell check is a critical success, the speed is increased by a number of feet equal to your [Magic] bonus.

You may cast this on an object to make it hover at a distance above the ground no greater than the spell's tier plus the points of success on the spell check. An object can hover beyond the spell's duration if you concentrate on the spell, with it hovering until this concentration is broken.

**At Higher Tiers**: In addition to the above listed benefits, each tier beyond minimum allows you to affect an additional creature/object or increase the hover speed by .5 yard.

**Critical Failure**: You and whatever you intended on affecting begin to float but do not possess the level of control as expected. Each affected creature is prone and vulnerable, with the speed given by this spell measured in inches, not yards. This state continues for a number of rounds equal to the points of success multiplied by this spell's tier. You gain a point of spell sickness for each other creature you had sought to affect when casting this spell.

### M (3

#### Missiles of Light

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 2 actions + 1 action per missile

**Range**: 25 yards

**Effect**: You produce up to 2 bolts of light which each strike a different target of your choice within range, inflicting radiant attacks. If an attack would qualify to damage a foe's armor, it instead blinds them for a number of rounds equal to the tier of the spell. Multiple missile may be combined into a unified attack against a foe. If so, only a single attack roll is made but it gains a +1 bonus for each additional missile which was combined this way.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to either increase the maximum number of missiles by 1, grant a +2 for the purpose of determining a critical hit with all attacks from the spell, or increase the range by 5 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You hurl the bolts of light, and as they scatter, the redirect themselves against you. Any combined missiles remain so. Each missile is staggered, with only one attacking each phase until each has had its turn (you may determine the order in which they attack you).

[Missiles of Light Spell]: # " Created at the request of Michael Hasty, who wanted a spell that produced 'missiles of light' which 'could blind'. This turned out to be a misunderstanding, so the Flare spell is also to be made."

#### Molten Form

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 1 yard

**Duration**: 1 minute

**Effect**: You transmute a creature, granting it a fiery aura and skin like molten rock. This confers a few changes to the creature  

 • Cannot be affected by fire in any manner.  
 • Cannot wear armor. Any flammable armor they are wearing is burnt up. They are treated as wearing brigandine.  
 • They do not receive damage from being crushed (including crushing attacks), falling, or knockback- but instead become dazed and prone for a number of rounds equal to the attack(s) total.  
 • Cold attacks against them have disadvantage and cause them to be prone for a number of rounds equal to the attack total. This is cumulative.  
 • Critical hits of Cold and Crushing attacks leave the subject vulnerable until the end of the round, even if the subject would not be wounded by it.  
 • Every round the subject spends at least half submerged in water reduces its move speeds by 1 foot until it spend twice as much time dry. This is cumulative. Once the subject's last mode of movement is reduced to 0 this way, it loses the ability to move at all until the appropriate amount of time has been spent dry.  
 • The subject puts off light like a torch.  
 • Any effect which would heal the subject has a 1 in 4 chance not to.  
 • They do not swim in water, instead walking on the surface below.

A creature may make a [Fort] save to avoid this if they wish.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may affect an additional creature and the range is increased to a number of yards equal to the spell's tier.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to transfer the transmutation properly. Yourself and any affected creature is set ablaze, as though a fire attack inflicted a critical hit. The save DV will be equal to the DV of the spell check.

#### Mortal Masque

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 1 yard

**Duration**: 1 hour

**Effect**: You magically reform the flesh of a corpse to appear as though it did in life. This can be applied to a reanimated corpse of some nature, but it must be able to cooperate for this.

Alternatively, if cast as a 3rd tier or higher spell, you may halve the total duration to have the corpse formed to appear as any member of the same species so long as your are familiar with that subject or have a detailed reference.

**Critical Failure**: You have managed deform it beyond recognition. You also receive additional points of spell-sickness equal to 1d3+half of the spell's tier.

### N (2 

#### Nightburn

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range** 9 yards

**Effect**: You produce an unnaturally cloroed flame which does not seem to emit light. You may psychically move this flame during each movement phase up to a number of yards equal to the spell's tier. You may also use your reaction to move the spell a number of yards equal to the tier + your [Magic] bonus. The flame must remain in range of you, and you must maintain concentration on it, or it ceases to exist.

The flame is not automatically snuffed out by water or other liquids, but can be extinquished by light. If it is exposed to fair light for a number of consecutive phases equal to the spell's tier- it is extinquished. Each phase in bright light is treated as 1d4 phases.

If the flame is directed into an object or creature, it inflicts a fire attack.

**At Higher Tiers**: The benefits for casting at higher times is noted above

**Critical Failure**: You fail to ignite the flame properly, inflicting an attack roll against yourself. If the attack roll is odd, its a fire attack. If even, necrotic. It gains a bonus equal to the spell'stier for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit against you.

#### Nralling

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 15 rounds

**Range**: 3 yards

**Effect**: You conjure an entity from a shadowy realm known as a Nral. It materializes within range. You may command it psychically for 3 minutes. Afterwards, it will no longer be bound by the spell and becomes hostile. It ceases to be after 6 minutes or when it would be destroyed normally.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the Nral's hitpoints are increased by 1. Additionally the time it exists under your purview and the time it exists afterwards is increased by a minute each. The casting time is increased by 2 rounds for each tier beyond minimum.

**Critical Failure**: The spell seems to function as normal, but it only remains subservient to you for a number of rounds equal to your [Magic] bonus minus the spell's tier (minimum of 1 round).

### O (3

#### Oozing Sphere

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Duration**: Minutes equal to the spell's tier

**Effect**: You create a sphere whose appearence is at your discretion on a surface you can touch. The size of this sphere is at least 1 foot in diameter, but can be up to a number of feet equal to the spell's tier + [Magic] bonus. This sphere moves in a direction of your choice at a speed of at least 2 yards per move, but no greater then a number of yards equal to the tier of the spell. If the surface bends more than 45 degrees, the sphere "drops" from the surface (having lost its grip) or impacts (if it is already rolling on the ground). The sphere leaves a trail of mucous everywhere it goes. Once the sphere impacts against something, it implodes. This spews acid everywhere for a number of yards equal to spell tier + 1d3. This acid has disadvantage on creatures with the Mucous feature. If the sphere never impacts, it never implodes and simply leaves that mucous behind.

On a critical success with your spellcheck, you may have the spell end at a set time before the normal end of duration, deciding so before the sphere begins to travel.

An attack on the sphere is successful with an attack total of 5 or mroe and will cause it to explode, spewing acid against everything within a number of feet equal to spell tier + 1d4.


**At Higher Tiers**: The benefits for higher tiers is noted above.

**Critical Failure**: The sphere doesn't form correctly and instantly explodes, inflicting an acid attack against you with a bonus equal to the spell tier for the purpose of determining a critical hit and leaving mucous on everything else within 1 yard.

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Effect**: Choose an exotic damage type. You create an orb of energy which you can direct around you, with it returning to your hand. You may swing it as a flail within 2 yards to inflict a dagger attack or you may hurl it a number of yards equal to double the spell's tier to inflict a sling attack or thrown blade attack. If the initial attack is successful, you inflict an attack of the chosen exotic type.

You may wind the globe as though it were a flail/sling. When used for a melee attack, if you have training with flails, you may benefit from it. If using it as a sling or thrown blade and you have training with the appropriate weapon, you may benefit from that training.

This ball of energy lasts until the end of the round, or it would qualify to damage armor (where the orb becomes compromised and breaks after the strike), whichever occurs first.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the exotic damage attack gains a +1 bonus for the purpose of determining a critical hit and you may have the energy ball last an additional round if it doesn't break.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to stablize the orb, causing it to explode. You are knocked back 1d8 feet and suffer an attack of the exotic attack with a bonus equal to the spell's tier.

**At Higher Tiers**:  Each tier beyond its minimum allows you to increease the level of the d4 die (to a d6, then a d8, etc, until it reachs a d12) and/or increase the size of the fan by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: You unintentionally localize the energy... inside of you. You suffer a psychic attack with advantage. After 1d12 rounds, a sphere of energy explodes out from you a number of feet equal to the spell tier. Everything in the sphere suffers a psychic attack, including yourself.

#### Portalence

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 action or reaction

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You open or close a portal (a door, window, container, etc) of a non-magical nature. You may lock/unlock any number of non-magical locks attached to the portal. A barre (or other lock which can run the entiry of one of the portal's dimensions) cannot be affected by this spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: If cast as second tier or beyond, you may lock/unlock any number of barres to the door. The spell can undo a magical lock of a spell whose tier is half or less of this spell's. Each tier beyond 1st also doubles the range of the spell.

**Critical Failure**: You have jammed the portal in such a way that it cannot function as you intended when casting the spell (opening or closing).

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 15 yards

**Effect**: You attempt the difficult task of seperating a creature's very consciousness temporarily, an art not easily mastered nor ever recommended.

On a critical failure, the creature becomes Mindless° for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier before becoming dazed.  

You may cast this on a creature that is already mindless. If it critically fails the save, it forgets any orders it had received and cannot receive any for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier.

**Critical Failure**: So long as you have spell sickness, you are mindless.

#### Psychoburst

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You produce an unstable portal connected to the psychic energy of a non-mindless creature within range. This inflicts a psychic attack against the target that does not wound them (though the effects of a critical hit still occur).

The attacks gain a bonus equal to the target's [Inte] bonus divided by the number of creatures in the explosion radius other than the target. Attacks from the explosion have disadvantage against mindless creatures unless they are connected to the psychic plane.  
Regardless of the spell's effect, if it is cast successfully, the caster knows the target's exact [Inte] score.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range at which you can reach a target is increased by 1 yard.

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Effect**: You touch a creature which has remained within a yard of you the entire time you cast the spell. It performs an incapacitation save which gains a bonus equal to the number of remaining hitpoints it currently has divided by the number of wounds it currently has. If the check is succesful, you heal a wound of your choice from the creature. If it is a critical success, it also recovers a hitpoint or an instance of hemorhaging (your choice as caster).  
Failure on the save does not harm the creature in anyway, but a critical failure prevents the creature from being affected by another Regeneration from the same caster of an equal or lower tier in the same day.

**At Higher Tiers**: For every tier beyond minimum, the save is made with a +1 bonus and increases the casting time by 1 minute.

**Critical Failure**: You must perform an incapacitation save with a penalty equal to the spell's tier. A critical failure will not kill you, but you will receive a wound.

#### Rotword

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 3 Yards

This has disadvantage against a creature that cannot hear you and the spell does not work if you cannot express the words (or equivalent sounds). The foe need not understand the words to be subject to them.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum increases the range by 3 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You words fail to produce their intended meaning and the fumbling causes great dissonance to yourself, leaving you vulnerable for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure or until an ally spends an action helping you come to your senses.

**Effect**: You produce a magical circle, filled with some incomprehensible fomrulae, which stretches out between 1 and 5 yards- either on the ground or the ceiling. The circle lasts for a number of days equal to the spell's tier.

Anything inside of the circle is incapable of influencing anything outside of the circle. This includes cast spells, using wands or other magic items, or the magical aspects of some feature. This circle can affect something regardless of how high or low from the circle it is, so long as no structure exists between them.

You may use your reaction to knockback a creature in the circle by 1d6 + spell tier feet. If it was trying to leave, you may choose to prevent the knockback from causing it to leave the circle. 

You may designate a material. A creature may use this material to dispel the circle by entering with it.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, allows you to increase the circle by up to 2 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You find yourself trapped in the circle, unable to leave it.

#### Sentinel

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 8 actions

**Range**: 3 yards

**Duration**: 1 minute or concentration (your choice when casting)

**Effect**: You create a glowing sphere of energy and choose a damage type from the following (Acid, Cold, Cutting, Electric, Fire, Force, Piercing, Radiant, Necrotic) within range. The sphere is small enough to fit in one's hand and can levitate up to 2 yards into the air. While it is active, so long as you can perceive the intended target, you may use your bonus action to produce a ray attack against them of the chosen type. This is treated identically to a wand attack. The sphere puts out dim light for half a foot and does not move on its own. 

If you can perceive it, you may use your action to guide it up to a number of feet equal to the spell's tier. You may also use your action to "set" it, causing it to fire on the next thing to enter its range or to move within its range (your choice). Such a thing must be illuminated in at least dim light to be visible to the sphere. It will ignore you for this purpose.

If the spellcheck was a critical success, you may have the sentinel gain an additional effect depending on the damage type you chose.  
* Acid: Anything below the sentinel is subjact to an acid attack at the end of each round as acid rythmically drips from the sphere. When the spell ends, you may have the sentinel explode, inflicting an acid attack against anyting within a number of half-feet equal to the spell's tier.
* Cold: Instead of potentially damaging armor, the sentinel's attack freezes a foe for a number of phases equal to the spell's tier -1.
* Cutting: The sphere can also attack in melee. When it does so, blades spin around it to inflict a cutting attack against everything within a number of half-feet equal to the spell's tier.
* Electric: Instead of potentially damaging armo, the attack arcs, inflicting an electric attack against the nearst creature within a number of yards equal to the spell's tier- even if it is not illuminated. A creature struck by any attack from this sentinel, including an arced attack, cannot be struck by an arced attack in the same phase.
* Fire: The sentinel puts out light like a torch. When the spell ends, you may have it explode. Anything within 1 foot must succeed a [Rflx] save with DV of 10+spell tier or be set ablaze as though by a critical hit from a fire attack.
* Force: A struck creature is knocked back a number of half-feet equal to the spell's tier +1.
* Piercing: The attacks of the sentinel can pierce through a struck foe in a straight line, potentially hitting other creatures.
* Radiant: The sentinel produces bright or fairlight (your choice) out a number of yards equal to the spell's tier, fair light out for a number of yards beyond that equal to the spell's tier, and dim light beyond that for a number of yards equal to the spell's tier.
* Necrotic: When the spell ends, you may have it explode, inflicting a necrotic attack against everything within a number of feet equal to the spell's tier -1.

**At Higher Tiers**: As seen above, a higher tier provides several benefits.

**Critical Failure**: The create the sentinel, but it seems to have a mind of its own. It will attempt to attack you during each action phase. In addition, it can attempt to attack the nearest creature to it at the end of each movement phase. A creature must be illuminated in at least dim light for the sphere to see it, but does not require that light to attack you. The sentinel always lasts for a minute this way.

#### Set Breath

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You manage to bestow up to two creatures in range an extended reserve of air. For a number of rounds equal to 2d8 plus double the Spell Tier, the creature need not breathe normally. This is rolled for each creature individually. A creature will know this effect is to expire at the start of the final round.

If a creature breathes another medium than air, the spell adjusts for that so long as it is cast in the appropriate medium.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may increase the time for each creature by 1d12 + spell tier or affect an additional creature.

**Critical Failure**: You struggle to breathe properly for a number of rounds equal to double the spell's tier- making you vulnerable during that time. If you do not breathe normally, you instead gain 1d4 points of spell sickness.

#### Shackling Order

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a magical binding at a foe within range, treat as an undamaging attack. If successful, the creature is prone and grappled by the bindings. The creature may attempt a [Body] check with a DV equal to the spellcheck's points of success plus the spell's tier. A success breaks the grappling effect of the bindings, but still leaves them prone as some of it remains intact. A critical success breaks the spell completely. A critical failure causes them to suffer a -4 penalty to further such checks until the end of the next round. A failure yields no result. Each round, the DV of the check required is reduced by 1 until it reach 0, at which point the bindings cease to exist.

A critical success with the undamaging attack disallows the attempts to break free during the same round.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 3 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You fumble with the bindings and bind yourself with this spell instead, pending the undamaging attack of course. The DV becomes the points of failure plus the spell's tier.

#### Silent Alarm

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 10 actions

**Range**: 50 yards

**Effect**: You magically mark a set point, up to 1 square foot, or a single portal (such as a door, window, or the opening of a container) you touch to alert you psychically if disturbed. In the case of a specific point, it is disturbed if something comes in contact with it. In the case of a portal, it is disturbed if opened or closed. Alternatively, you may have the spell psychically connected to an arcane device instead of yourself.

Once disturbed, if you are within the alarm's range, you will be alerted to the intrusion (or the possessor of the arcane device).

Everything in the line is subject to a necrotic attack, which is resolved in the order of nearest (to point of origin) to farthest. For each creature other than one of an exlcuded type mentioned below which has been successfully wounded by this spell, the attack gains a +1 bonus. A creature killed as a result of this spell (including a failed incapacitation save caused by the spell) provides a further +1 to further attacks in the same instance of this spell. A creature of undeath successfully struck by this spell loses additional points of undeath equal to the spell's tier.

Excluded creatures include Constructs, Elementals, Ephemera, Fiends, and Undead. These creatures still suffer an attack (with any accrued bonuses) but do not contribute any additional bonus to further attacks from the spell, even if destroyed this way.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum allows you to send the wave 1 yard further.

**Critical Failure**: You have tapped into something you shouldn't. Inflict a number of necrotic attacks against yourself equal to half of this spell's tier and a nectrotic attack against every creature (including yourself) within 3 yards of a non-excluded type. The attacks against you gain a bonus for the purpose of determining a critical hit equal to the spell's tier.

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You produce a striking spray of radiant color, inflicting a radiant attack against the foe.

You may choose the color of the struck foe's glow when they are hit.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack.

**Critical Failure**: You produce a flash of light, blinding yourself until your spell sicknesss recovers. Additionally, you glow a shifting hue, as though you had been affected by the spell, for a number of minutes equal to the spell's tier. The hue varies as time goes on.

The sphere lasts for a number of rounds equal to the points of success on the spell check. Any creature that enters the sphere suffers a cold attack. A creature which ends the round in the sphere also receives a cold attack.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum sees the sphere extend out an additional foot in all directions.

**Casting Time**: 5 Actions

**Duration**: 1 + [Magic] bonus minutes

**Effect**: You project a strange foaming fluid in a 5 yard line, which is .5 foot high and wide. Choose two different exotic damage types, one for protection and one for vulnerability. Anything within the line is covered in a strange concoction of your making for the duration of the spell. Attacks of the type choosen for protection have disadvantage against someone covered. Attacks of the type chosen for vulnerability have advantage against something covered this way. You may choose to spray a cone instead of a line, ut this reduces the range to one third.

A critical success with the spell check will allow you to produce an additional line as an action so long as there is still duration to the spell.

A creature's Mucous feature protects it from this.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to extend the range of the spell's line by 1 yard or the duration by 1 minute.

**Critical Failure**: You manage to spray yourself with a strange fluid. Make a [Fort] save with a DV equal to the points of failure + the spell's tier. Attacks of both chosen types have advantage against you for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure.


#### Starfall

**Minimum Tier**: 6

**Casting Time**: 20 actions

**Range**: 100 yards

**Effect**: You designate a 17 yard by 17 yard space within range. After 1d10 rounds, this spell calls down a number of magical projectiles, which fall like meteors, equal to the d10 result + the spell's tier + [Magic] bonus. Divide the projectiles by the number of creatures in the area, rounding down. This is the number of attacks made against each creature within the space. An even attack roll is a radiant attack and an odd attack roll is a ki attack. If there was a fraction, the caster may use their reaction to direct an additional such attack against a creature they can perceive within the area.

If the spell check was a critical success, you may replace the d10 with any of the following dice (d4, d6, d8, d12). The number of attacks inflicted is still reflected by this change.

**At Higher Tiers**: In addition to the above mentioned benefit, each tier beyond minimum can afford one of the following benefits;

#### Stupify

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

If it impacts, the sphere explodes causing anything within 5 yards to be subject to the explosion. The explosion will, in order; perform a radiant attack, a fire attack, and an electric attack against anything caught. If an attack is successful in any degree, it grants the next attack advantage.

Against Eldritch, Elemental, and Fey creatures, the spell cannot inflict a critical hit. Against undead, each attack gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purposes of determining if the attack is a critical hit.

The globe can stop at the directed point and hover in place. While active this way, the globe shines bright light for 50 yards, fair light for 100 yards beyond that, and dim light for 150 yards beyond that. This light also dispels magical darkness of a lower tier within the area it illuminates.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum can either increase the range of the sphere's journey by 25 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The sphere doesn't stablize as it forms, causing it to detonate in your grasp. The attacks from the spell gain a bonus against you equal to the spell's tier. Additionally, anything within range must succeed a DV 18 [Prcp] or [Rflx] save or be blinded for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure. You are instead blinded for a number of hours equal to the points of failure. Even if you succeed your save, you will be blind for a number of minutes equal to the spell's tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum sees the range increase by 3 yards.

You may concentrate on the spell, This allows you to move it on movement phases so long as you perform no other actions and maintain concentration. If an object is capable of moving or being moved this way, subtract the macimum distance you can move the object by an amount equal to that movemnt, but the other movement is not applied. If the other movement would be greater than the maximum movement you can move the object- your grasp is broken and you have no affect on the object.

A creature can be moved this way but counts as triple its weight.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum can either increase the range, increase the distance the object can be moved, or increase the weight.  
If increase range, it is increased by a number of yards equal to the spellcheck's point of success.  
If increasing the distance the object is moved, it is increased by a number of feet equal to the spellcheck's points of success.  
If increasing the maximum weight of the object moved, the new weight maximum (measured in stones) is equal to 1 + additional tiers devoted this way, squared.

Whatever is suggested cannot be something whose effect would be greater than a number of hours equal to the spell's tier. This cannot be something that would knowingly cause great harm to it or violate their moral tenets. A mindless creature has disadvantage against this and clearly has no concerns with morality or its own self preservation.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier above minimum, you may target an additional creature within range.

**Critical Failure**: You have managed to attract the attention of those creatures you sought to tell. For a number of days equal to the points of failure, they will attempt to destroy you in any way they can.

When this inflicts a critical hit against an undead creature, to reduces its points of undeath by an amount equal to the spell's tier squared. If that creature does not have points of undeath, the attack instead gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier. Against non-undead creatures, if the attack is a critical hit, it also inflicts a piercing attack against the creature.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the range is increased by 5 yards (including the range for redirection) and the biting attack gains a +1 bonus for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.

**Critical Failure**: The spirit conjured is quite upset with you. It grapples you for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. You cannot fight against this.

Any creature† which attempts to enter the space of the globe must succeed a [Will] save with a DV of triple the spell's tier + your [Magic] bonus or fail to do so. Additionally, if such a cretaure attempts to enter the globe, the caster may use their reaction to preven them from doing so.

The globe can be destroyed as though it were a creature of undeath. Non-magical attacks must be made against the outer barrier of the globe itself to be effective. Magical atttacks passing through the barrier from outside are inflicted against the globe instead of their target. Other magical attacks against or through the space of the barrier function normally.

At the end of each round, any creature† within the sphere is subject to a necrotic attack.

**Casting Time**: 6 actions

**Range**: 3 yards

**Effect**: From you emits a circle of energy which disturbs the very nature of the necromantic bindings of undead creatures, which extends out to the range of the spell.

Additionally, creatures of undeath within the circle lose 1d12+[Magic] bonus points of undeath per tier of the spell.  
Any undead creature first affected by the circle of the spell is subject to an undamaging attack. If it is a critical sucess, the creature is destroyed.

Furthermore, you may use your reaction to inflict an additional attack against an undead or ephermal creature of a type not chosen from the options of the circle without breaking your concentration on the spell.

Furthermore, you may opt to have the shape changed to a fan or semifan, but this halves the length.

This can blow away gasses and vapors, including those of a magical nature.

When you cast this, you may choose for recipients to understand the message to be of your voice or as an unknown voice.

A critical success with the spell allows you to do one of the following;

A critical success with the spell check lets it last for a number of rounds equal to half of the points of success.

Non-magical projectiles (including any loose object which is thrown or otherwise propelled but not carried by a creature) which are not larger than the surface of the barrier cannot pass through it, nor can the rays of wands and staves. Projectiles and rays from spells whose total tier is less than half of this spell's tier cannot bypass the wall.  Magical items (including magical munitions of a weapon) passing through the barriar have their total movement/range reduced by a number of yards equal to the spell's tier. In the case of those carried by a creature, there is no effect unless it is armor. A creature attempting to pass through the barrier in magical armor has that movement reduced by a number of feet equal to the spell's tier. Note that the given falling speed of a creature is likely to exceed the loss caused by the barrier, making this ineffective to use as a bridge for those donning magic armor.

* Prevent water from exiting the space.
* Choose the direction the water flows.
* Move it up to a number of feet equal to the points of success.
* Direct the water to inflict a force attack against a foe. Instead of inflicting a wound, the foe is knocked back a number of feet equal to the spell's tier.
* Direct the water to inflict a crushing attack against a foe. Instead of inflicting a wonund, the foe is knocked prone.

This spell is active as long as you concentrate on it. When casting or concentrating on this spell, you may spend any additional number of additional actions to increase the volume you can affect by a number of cubic feet equal to the spell's tier.

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You produce translucent orb wrapped in swirling shadows, just a few inches in diameter, which is then directed in a straight line to a point you designate within range. Upon impact, it seems to disappear. At the end of the round, it implodes from where it impacted. The size of this effect is variable, affecting everything within 1d12+6 yards. Anything caugt within the area is subject to a Necrotic attack.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum can can affect the implosion radius (increasing or decreasing) by 1 yard, this decision is made after the d12 is rolled.

**Critical Failure**: Instead of forming the orb, the shadows swirl around you. For a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier, you are subject to a necrotic attack at the end of each round. When one of these attacks fails to harm you, you accrue a point of spell sickness. You also have disadvantage on all [Prcp] checks and saves during this time.

**Critical Failure**: You manage to get halfway to your target, but fail to appear properly and are prone until the end of the round as you lose your bearings. Each tier beyond 1st adds a another round in which you are disoriented, leaving you prone.

#### Wretched Ray

**Minimum Tier**: 2

#### Wurmvalder

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a serpentine spirit of nature to strike a foe within range, treat as a biting attack. You may treat a critical hit as though it were a toxic attack. If the attack would qualify to damage the foe's armor or be a critical hit, it explodes out 4 yards to inflict an acid attack against anything within the explosion.

The spirit ceases to be after a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier.

The caster may use their reaction to redirect the spirit to attack another, inflicting the biting attack as usual.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 2 yards or the explosion radius by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: The spirit conjured is quite upset with you. It grapples you for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. You cannot fight against this. During the primary action phase while you are grappled, it inflicts a biting attack against you. During the secondary action phase of each such round, it inflicts a acid attack. You are prone during this time.

Upon a critcal success with your spell check or a critical failure on the target's save, you may increase or decrease the creature's inebriation by an amount up to the spell's tier.

This cannot affect Eldritch, Ephemera, Fiends, or Undead.
