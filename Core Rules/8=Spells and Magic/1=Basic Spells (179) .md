Basic spells are those that a newer player could be exposed to knowing. Anytime a class or species' feature allows a character to gain a spell, it should be selected from this list.

### A (13

#### Abatis

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You cause a number of trees or rocks within range to fall in such a way as to provide barriers that feature protrusions up to 2 feet in front of you (or enough to block about 1/3 of your form), with the barrier itself being dependant upon the materials. Any large or larger creature, or medium or larger mount, moving into contact with the barrier is subject to a piercing attack and must succeed either a [Body] or [Rflx] save (their choice) or be stopped. If a [Body] save is failed this way, treat the creature as impacting against the barrier, receiving knockback damage as though the remainder of the distance it was traveling was the knockback distance. If a [Rflx] save is failed this way, the creature is knocked prone.  
This barrier lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell check's points of success multiplied by the spell's tier.

If the caster is larger or smaller than Medium, adjust the size of the barrier accordingly.

The DV of the save is equal to double the spell's tier + the number of size classes above diminutive of the caster + the spell-check's points of success.

**At Higher Tiers**: As seen above, a higher tier provides several benefits.

**Critical Failure**: The barriers fall on you, inflicting a Force attack, Crushing attack, and Piercing attack- each with a bonus equal to the spell's tier. The barrier is created, of course, and lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1d12 + spell tier.

#### Abaxiate

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 3 yards

**Duration**: 3 rounds

**Effect**: You hold this spell for its duration, during which you may use your reaction in response to an object or creature moving (before knowing what direction it plans to move in) to designate a new direction for it to move. If it is not phsyically possible for it to move in that direction with its chosen mode of movement, the movement is treated as knockback movement.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the range by 1 yard and duration by 1 round.

**Critical Failure**: You instead affect yourself with the spell. If you had already targeted yourself, you instead fail to move.

#### Ablative Guard

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting TIme**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to a non-magical attack against yourself

**Effect**: You gain a bonus to defense against that attack equal to the lowest of the spell's tier or your [Magic] bonus as a magical field of force projects from yourself and covering the entirety of the direction. The forcefield then continues to exist for a total number of phases equal to the spell's tier. Magical attacks bypass the barrier completely and reduce its lifespan by 1 phase. Critical hits cause the forcefield to dissipate automatically. Fire attacks of any nature will destroy the barrier before affecting the caster.

**At Higher Tiers**: The benefits for higher tiers are noted above.

**Critical Failure**: You gain 1d4 points of spell sickness.

#### Abolish Abomination

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Effect**: Your touch seeks to undo a most unnatural form of creature. If you target a bigenerae, eldritch, or monster- you inflict an unlisted attack against it as the spell seeks to to tear it apart. Additionally, regardless of the creature's type- you inflict an unlisted attack against it and a crushing attack. If it is a biginerae, eldritch, or monster type creature- it must succeed a [Fort] save with a DV equal to the spell check result or suffer 2 wounds and then perform an incapacitation save. If it was a bigenerae, the DV is increased by the spell's tier. Additionally, any creature of undeath affected by this spell loses points of undeath equal to the spellcheck's points of success.

A critical hit by an unlisted attack of this spell inflicts an additional wound or reduces a creature's points of undeath by the spellcheck's points of success.

A creature killed by this spell is completely destroyed and almost unrecognisable. It cannot be reanimated by any means.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the caster may choose one of the following;
* The casting time is reduced by 1 action (to a minimum of 1 action)
* The first attack inflicted by the spell against a creature gains a +1 bonus.
* The crushing attack against a creature gains a +2 bonus for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit.
* The DV of the [Fort] save is increased by 5.
* The incapacitation save inflicted by a failed [Fort] save from the spell is increased by 2.

**Critical Failure**: You inflict two unlisted attacks against yourself. The second attack gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit. These attacks will inflict an additional unlisted attack as the result of a critical hit against you.

#### Abnegate

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You attempt to counter a spell being cast, as though you knew the spell, so long as it half the tier or lower than this spell. You must still perform a counterspell check. The foe gains a bonus to their check equal to their spell's tier and you gain a bonus equal to this spell's tier.
If you critcally fail your counterspell check, you cannot affect the spell with another abnegation of the same or lower tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: As seen above, a higher tier provides several benefits.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to counter the spell and infact have strengthened the caster against further counterspells equal to the difference in tier of this spell and their own.

#### Absend

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You cause an object to return to the relative position it occupied up to a number of minutes ago equal to the tier of the spell. A creature can be targeted by this spell, but is instead returned a point occupied measured in rounds not minutes. A creature affected by this must make a [Rflx] save or become prone or vulnerable (their choice, if they are already affected by one, they must choose the other). You may choose to grant that creature a bonus to its save equal to your [Magic] bonus.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier above minimum increases the range by 1 yard and the casting time by 1 action.

**Critical Failure**: You accidentally are affected by this spell instead. Additionally, as a result of the spell, you must succeed a [Fort] save or be Obtunded for a number of rounds equal to the tier of the spell.

#### Absenting

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to moving

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You instantly disappear. After 1d12 rounds, you move to a point in range of your choosing.

#### Alacering

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**At Higher Tiers**: Other than the above listed benefit, for each tier beyond minimum, the distance you move if basing the distance on the spell check result is increased by 1d4+1 feet.

**Effect**: You magically mark a set point, up to 1 square foot, or a single portal (such as a door, window, or the opening of a container) you touch to produce stimuli of one of the five basic senses which can be perceived by anything within range. In the case of a specific point, it is disturbed if something comes in contact with it. In the case of a portal, it is disturbed if opened or closed.

So long as a creature has use of the selected sense and there is no obstruction to the stimuli, any creature within the tange will detect the stimuli.

This spell lasts a number of hours equal to the points of success (minimum of 1) multiplied by the total number of minutes spent casting the spell.

Once the alarum has been triggered, you may return it to its passive state as an action by taking on a point of spell-sickness. Another caster may try to do so as an action by performing a Spellcraft chrck with a DV equal to quadruple the spell's tier + your [Magic] bonus. The time spent "activated" still counts against the lifespan of the alarum.

**At Higher Tiers**: If cast as second tier or beyond, may produce stimuli of mulitple basic senses up to the tier of the spell, but the range is divided by the total number of senses for which stimuli is produced. Each tier beyond 1st also increases the range of the spell by 10 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You seem to have set the alarum just fine. The alarum is just as likely to randomly trigger as it is not to trigger when disturbed at all.

#### Aldervalder

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a spirit of nature to strike a foe within range, treat as a biting attack. The spirit ceases to be after a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier +1 and can be redirected against a new foe as a reaction. If no new target is chosen, it will inflict a bite against the same foe at the end of the secondary action phase.

As a reaction, it can be directed at a creature which is missing hitpoints. It must succeed an incapacitation save. If successful to any degree, the creature recovers a hitpoint. A failure yields no negative consequences. The spirt ceases to exist upon such an attempt. It may only recover a hitpoint lost while the spirit existed.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 2 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The spirit conjured is quite upset with you. It grapples you for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. You cannot fight against this. During the primary action phase while you are grappled, it inflicts a biting attack against you. You are prone during this time.

#### Arc Lightning

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 15 yards

**Effect**: You invoke a bolt of lightning to strike a foe within range. If the attack would damage the foe's armor or be a critical hit, it arcs to hit the nearest creature.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may either reduce the casting time by 1 action (to a minimum of 1) or the range by 15 yards. Alternatively, you may devote some of the additional tiers to creating a larger Artificicheir (per that creature's description).

**Casting Time**: 100 Rounds

**Range**: (Spellcheck result) yards x10

The fog may move slowly, with a number of square feet receeding up to the tier + spellcheck's points of success, with it spreading out elsewhere an equal number of square feet. This movement requires the caster maintain concentration on it. The fog does not need to conform to a standard shape, so long as it is contiguous.

**Range**: 5 yards

**Duration**: 5 minutes

As an action, the creature to which the crown is affixed may project out a cone of this darkness whose length is equal to the spell's tier in yards. The obscurement provided by the cones lasts until the end of the next round.

A creature adorned with the crown may attempt a [Will] check with a DV of 10 + the spell's tier as an action to peer through the obscurement until the end of the round. If the check is a critical success, they may remove the crown- dispelling the magic entirely.

#### Cryoschimurgy

**Minimum Tier**: 2

These items can be standard non-magical weapons, shields, munitions, or any other item the narrator deems to be reasonable (other than firearms or the string of bows, for obvious reasons). There must be enough total ice in range to produce the items, which will weigh one third the normal weight. These items last a number of half-minutes equal to the tier of the spell, at which point it begins to melt (if warm enough) and misshape. The workings of armor is too complicated for this spell.

A fire attack which would be reasonably assumed to come in contact with such an item will destroy it. Any attack by such an ice weapon which would qualify to damage armor instead breaks the weapon, as does a critical failure. If a shield is made with the ice, used to block, and the incoming attack would qualify to damage armor- the shield is destroyed.

You may use water in place of ice to produce an item, with a single serving being treated as half a pound of material, but this increases the time to forge the item by 1 action.

You may only produce a number of items equal to the tier of the spell, with a critical success increasing this by [Magic] bonus.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows, in addition to the above noted benefits, one of the following;
* The casting time is reduced by 1 action.
* The range is increased by 1 yard.
* The item last an additional half-minute.

**At Higher Tiers**: When cast at higher tiers, for each tier beyond minimum, you may choose one of the following
* The duration is increased by 2 hours.
* The bonus to defense and saves against spells is increased by 1, but so is the penalty to spellchecks and counterspell checks.

**Effect**: You must be in darkness to cast this spell. You shroud yourself in shadows which attach themselves to you, granting the following benefits so long as you are in dim light or darkness
* You gain a bonus to the visual difficulty of being detected when attempting stealth equal to the spell's tier.
* The penalty to your stealth for making noise is reduced by the spell's tier.
* Footprints and other tracks you make last for only 6 minutes before disappearing.

In addition, the first attack made against you each round has disadvantage.

At the end of any phase you are exposed to bright light, perform a counterspell check (not opposed) with a DV of 12. If you fail, the spell ends.

If the spellcheck was a critical success, you may concentrate on the spell. While you concentrate on it this way, and until that concentration is broken, the spell is not subjected to the normal limit of its duration.

**At Higher Tiers**: When cast at 4th tier or higher, the spell gains one of the following advantages for each tier beyond minimum
* The duration is increased by 1.

* The reduction in noise penalty is increased by 1.
* The time your tracks last is reduced by 1 minute (hypothetically, a tier 9 spell instantly undoes your tracks).

**Critical Failure**: The shadows wrap around you and constrict you. You are prone so long as there is any light, have disadvantage on counterspell checks, suffer a penalty to visual stealth equal to the spell's tier so long as you are not in darkness, and radiant attacks have advantage against you. This lasts for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure multiplied by the spell's tier.

#### Deathly Foil

**Minimum Tier**: 4

**Casting Time**: 10 rounds

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You create a field where healing magics cannot function properly extending out from yourself or a point in space you touch. This field exists as long as you concentrate on it and a number of rounds afterwards equal to the spell's tier. Any magical effect which would restore a hitpoint appears not to have an effect. During the same phase of the following round, if a creature had their hitpoint recovery prevented this way, it must make an incapacitation save.

A magical effect which would heal a wound appears to heal the wound, until the same phase of the following round.

If a creature performs an incapacitation save and the die result is odd, it loses 1 hitpoint if it has any.

Effects that restore points of undeath from within the field or affecting a target within the field have the total points recovered halved (round down).

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to increase the range of the field by up to 2 yards or increase the duration of it by 1 round.

**Critical Failure**: You have attempted to interfere with the cycle of life and death, disturbing something incomprehensible. Every minute, for a number of hours equal to the spell's tier, perform an incapacitation save- even if you would normally ignore such saves. You cannot have hitpoints, wounds, or points of undeath restored so long as you still have spell sickness.

#### Debriation

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Effect**: You touch a substance or container including a substance and magically remove the alcohol (and some other compounds) from it. You may reduce the total points of inebriation a single serving (the next serving in fact) can bestow by an amount equal to the spell's tier. Alternatively, if a container holds multiple servings, this can reduce the total amount of inebriation each serving would provide by the spell's tier divided (round down) by the total amount of servings multiplied by the inebriation granted by each serving.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the range is increased. It will reach a number of yards equal to the spell's tier, squared.

**Range**: 3 yards

**Effect**: You cast a recitation which is expressed in low, earth-shaking, tones. Everything within range is subject to a sonic attack. Additionally, every creature in range which could hear you must succeed a [Fort] save or be dazed until the end of the next phase. At the end of the phase, you may decide to continue performing the same recitation to continue the effect. This requires a spellcheck as normal, but suffers a -1 cumulative penalty for each phase you have continued this. This consumes the whole of your activity for the phase and you cannot take reactions while doing so. The attack and save occur again during each phase this is continued. Additionally, the range of the spell is increased by 1 yard after each phase.
You cannot be affected by another's Deep Chant of lower level while reciting your own.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the original extends the range by 1 yard.

* The range is increased by 1.5 yards.
* The casting time is reduced by 1 action, to a minimum of 1 action.

If it has been affected by a 1st tier spell, or a source determined to be equivalent by the narrator, the effect is supressed for this spell's duration. 

If such a magic's tier would be less than half of this spell's, there is also a percentage chance that the magic is disrupted to the point that it no longer functions (though can be "repaired" by certain means). This is equal to this spell's tier plus the points of success on the spellcheck.

When used against a forcefield created by a spell of less than half of this spell's tier, that forcefield is destroyed.

While constricting a foe, treat as a grapple with the following exception. Your value is equal to the spell check result + spell tier. The grappled target cannot use [Rflx] to escape. A critical success breaks the grasp of the ertvalder, preventing it from constricting the target for the remainder of the round.

This flare produces bright out 1 yard, fair light out 2 yards from there, and dim light 2 yards beyond that. If fired at a foe, it inflicts a radiant attack. Instead of inflicting a wound- it simply adheres to that creature. If the attack would qualify to damage a foe's armor, even if they wear none, instead blind the foe for a number of rounds equal to the attack roll total. A critical hit still inflicts the the usual result.

These flares last 15 minutes

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to either increase the maximum number of missiles by 1, increase the range by 5 yards, or increase the durations by a number of minutes equal to 10 + [magic] bonus.

**Effect**: You conjure a flaming serpentine spirit of nature to strike a foe within range, treat as a biting attack. You may treat a critical hit as though it were a fire attack. If the attack would qualify to damage the foe's armor or be a critical hit, it wraps around the foe causing them to be prone. The creature may attempt a save as an action to remove it (exact nature is at Narrator's discretion) with a DV equal to double the spell's tier + caster's [Magic] bonus. At the end of each round, if it is wrapped around a foe or object, it inflicts a fire attack against it.

The spirit ceases to be after a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier.

The caster may use their reaction to redirect the spirit to attack another, inflicting the biting attack as usual.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 2 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The spirit conjured is quite upset with you. It grapples you for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. You cannot fight against this. During the primary action phase while you are grappled, it inflicts a biting attack against you. During the secondary action phase of each such round, it inflicts a fire attack. You are prone during this time.

### G (7

#### Glacial Brand

**Minimum Tier**: 4

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Duration**: 1 minute

**Effect**:  You bind a frostbitten rune onto a creature you can perceive with range. Anytime the creature moves, it is subject to a cold attack. If the attack would qualify to damage armor, it instead halves the creature's speed until the end of the next round.

**At Higher Tiers**: When cast at 5th tier or higher, the range increases by 5 yards per tier beyond minimum.

**Critical Failure**: The brand forms on you instead and lasts for a total of 5 rounds per spell tier.

#### Glitter

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 25 yards

**Duration**: 1 minute

**Effect**: You cause an explosion of reflective powder to burst out from a point you designate. This powder coats everything within 1d4+3 yards and hangs in the air for the duration. Anything within the initial explosion receives 1d2 points of spell sickness. Additionally, anything covered in the powder suffers a -1 to spellchecks, counterspell checks, and saves against spell. If a creature covered in the glitter brawls with, tramples, or is trampled by another creature- that creature also finds some of the shiny dust on themself (suffering the proper penalties). Radiant attacks moving through the cloud of powder have disadvantage. Illusory magics caused by spells of a tier less than half of this spell's has its nature exposed by the dust. Because is it a glittering powder, an invisible creature afflicted by it can still be tracked visually.

Hypothetically, 5 whole minutes of fully submerged washing could preemtively dissolve the powder before its natural expiration.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to either increase the duration by 1 minute or the range of the explosion by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: You create a small puff of the glitter- just enough to coat yourself. It lasts as long as you have spell sickness.

#### Gnash

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 25 yards

**Effect**: Against a diminutive creature or object, you conjure a forcefield in the shape of a jaw to clamp down in rapid succession. This inflicts a biting attack and crushing attack against it.

**Critical Failure**: You bind yourself in a jaw shaped forcefield instead, making you prone and unable to escape. At the end of each round, it inflicts a biting and crushing attack against you. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier.

[Gnash Spell]: # "Created in response to someone joking about there being a Gnash spell in an XP to Level 3 video. Also, adds a nice powerful combat spell that has a high risk for the user."

#### Grasp

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 15 yards

**Effect**: You create a magical force to take hold of a creature or object. Once grasped this way you may attempt one of the following; throw, slam, or hold.

If throwing a creature or object, treat as a shove with the following exceptions. Your value is equal to the spell check result + spell tier + [magic] bonus. An object does not add a [Body] score it does not have. If you throw it into yourself, you may make a [Rflx] save (with a DV equal to the DV of this spell's spell check) to have it safely sent to your grasp. A critical failure's effects are determined by the narrator.

If slamming a foe, treat as a normal slam with the following exceptions. Your value is equal to the spell check result + spell tier + [magic] bonus.

If holding, treat as a normal grapple with the following exceptions. Your value is equal to the spell check result + spell tier + [magic] bonus. The grappled target cannot use [Rflx]. You must concentrate for the entirety of the hold for it to continue. The grappled target gets a +1 bonus for every whole round that passes while held. A critical success breaks the grasp of the spell, ending it.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, can increase the range by 10 yards or reduce the casting time by 1 action (to aminimum of 2).

**Critical Failure**: The field you create instead surrounds yourself, making you prone and vulnerable for a number of rounds equal o the spell's tier. Your movement speeds are reduced by half during this time.

#### Grave Blast

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 yards

**Effect**: As an additional cost to cast this spell, you must hold the skull of a sapiant creature. The skull will disintigrate if the spell is successfully cast. Choose two exotic damage types. From the skull a pitch black ball of energy fired. On impact it will inflict a necrotic attack. In place of a traditional critical hit, it inflicts the critical hit effects of the two damage types selected. If the attack would qualify to damage armor, it instead dazes the foe until the end of the next round.

If the attack roll against the foe was successful and the die roll result was odd, you may choose to either have the foe emit dim light out for 1 foot or reduce the level of light within 1 foot of the foe for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier + [Magic] bonus.

A critical success with the spellcheck does not consume the skull.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum grants the attack an additional +1 bonus.

**Critical Failure**: The skull levitates and faces you, blasting you with unintended powers. It inflicts two attacks against you, one of each chosen type. These attacks gains a bonus against you equal to half of the spell's tier for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit. It then disintigrates.

#### Gravitic Disruption

**Minimum Tier**: 4

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 30 yards

• Jump distances are doubled.  
• Climb and fly speeds are increased by half.  
• When the effect occurs, and anytime a creature's movement is performed through the sphere, a [Rflx] save must made or the creature is made prone as it slips and fumbles through the air. It remains prone until the end of the round or it leaves the area. A critical failure results in it also being vulnerable.  
• One's effective fall distance is halved.

Once this effect ends, the power of gravity becomes intensified until the end of the next round, causing the following;

• Jump distances are halved.  
• Climb and fly speeds are halved.  
• When the effect occurs, and anytime a creature's movement is performed through the sphere, a creature must succeed a [Body] save or be knocked prone as it gets pulled to the ground. It is prone until the end of the round or it leaves the area. A critical failure results in it being vulnerable as well.  
• When the effect occurs, each creature suffers a crushing attack. At the end of the round, any creature still in the area suffers a crushing attack. 

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to extend either of the effects by one round.

**Critical Failure**: Flip a coin. If heads, you will be subject to the effect of the weakened gravity and have disadvantage on your save. If tails, you are subject to the intensified gravity effect. Regardless, you will be vulnerable until the end of the next round.

#### Green Ward

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which is taken in response to a creature attacking or coming in contact with you or a creature/object you are touching

#### Hallowed Binding

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 30 yards

**Effect**: You bind a supernatural foe to its current space, treating it as being grappled. The creature may attempt a [Will] check with a DV equal to the spellcheck's points of success plus the spell's tier. A success breaks the grappling effect of the bindings. A critical success breaks the spell completely. A critical failure causes them to suffer a -4 penalty to further such checks until the end of the next round. A failure yields no result.

You must retain concentration on the spell to maintain its effects. You may use your reaction to impose one of the following conditions on the affected creature (Dazed, Immobile, Prone, Vulnerable) until the end of the round so long as you can perceive the point you set the binding.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may affect an additional creature within range or increase the range by 5 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The spell instead afflicts you with the inability to silence your noise hole(s). You are dazed for a number of minutes equal to the spell's tier as you partake in such a fit.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum increase the volume of ice you may affect as described above.

The warded creature is immune to the effects of a toxic attack's critical hit and there is a percentage chance that any point of contact, for the purpose of contracting a disease or other illness, will be ignored equal to the spell's tier squard. The entire duration of such a contact must be during the spell's duration to provide protection this way. Additionally, non-magical toxic attacks against the warded creature have disadvantage, as do any toxic attacks as a result of a poison or disease.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the duration by 1 hour.

**Critical Failure**: You gain 1d4-1 points of spell sickness and appear ill so long as you have spell sickness.

#### Inspoil

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Effect**:  You touch an amount of food or water, spoiling it of any nutrition or benefit. You affect a total number of servings equal to the spell's level.

#### Imbue

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 40 actions

**Duration**: 1 hour

**Effect**: You touch a weapon, piece of ammunition, piece of armor, or some other object.

Any item touched by this is considered magical for all intents and purposes. It does not have any special effect inherently, but is considered magical (and thus can cause its interactions to be treated as being performed with a magical weapon/item).

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may either halve the casting time or increase the duration by 1 hour. Alternatively, if you cast it at least 3 tiers beyond minimum- you may treat it as an enchanted weapon/armor (as appropriate) of a variety of your choice. If you do, the duration of the spell is measured in minutes and not hours.

**Critical Failure**: You accidentally curse the item in some way. You possess the same curse as the magic item. This curse lasts for a number of days equal to the spell's tier.

#### Infuse

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

For a number of rounds equal to the points of success multiplied by the spell's tier, if the liquid is splashed on a creature, it can inflict an attack of the chosen type. The attack does not inflict a wound if successful, but will inflict the effect of a critical hit. The attack gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier if hurled at a foe as an action. A whole serving is required to inflict such an attack.

An ingested quantity always treats the foe's defense as being equal to its [Fort] score. A critical failure this way alerts the imbiber to its potential nature.

**At Higher Tiers**: The benefits are noted above.

**Critical Failure**: You create an unstable reaction, instead inflict an attack of the chosen type against yourself with a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of determining a critical hit.

This is bright light stretching out 1 yard, fair light stretching out 5 yards beyond that, and dim light stretching out 8 yards beyond that. If you perform an unarmed attack with such a body part, and the attack is successful, it applies the critical hit effect of a radiant attack. You suffer no penalties for the bright light generated by your spell.

Anytime you perform a move (of any kind), are moved by an effect, or take a reaction while the spell is active, roll a d20. If the result is an 11 or higher, the light will flicker out (ending the spell). If you are maintaining concentration, a 14 or higher is required.

This spell may only be cast during the day and cannot be cast during an eclipse.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum can improve one of the following;

**Duration**: 18 hours + 3 hours per tier

**Effect**: You produce a trap which possesses a 2 yard cone-shaped trigger. This trigger may be set to activate based on visual changes (such as light changing), sound, or the presnce of a creature. Additionally you may set the trap to delay its activation by a number of rounds up to its tier. Once the trap itself activates, it secretly inflicts a toxic attack against each creature within the cone. This attack does not inflict a wound like normal. The trap then disappears. For the remainder of the spell, the caster may use their reaction to force any creatures they perceive which were successfully attacked to succeed a [Fort] save or have their hitpoints reduced by 1.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, trap's cone is increased by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: You are afflicted by a magical poison. Every minute for the duration of the spell, you must succeed a [Fort] save with a DV of 15 or have your hitpoints reduced by 1.

#### Ironside

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Duration**: 1 minute

**Effect**: You touch a creature (which could be yourself), transmuting its skin (or surface material) to be a thick metal coating. This confers a few changes to the creature  

 • Do not need to breathe, but will be dazed if they would normally need to do so and can't. This is due to the unusual sensation that occurs from their muscle memory when the body is denied the opportunity.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom from external sources.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh.   
 • Do not benefit from armor. They are treated as wearing plate.  
 • They do not receive damage from being crushed (including crushing attacks), falling, or knockback- but instead become dazed and prone for a number of rounds equal to the attack(s) total.  
 • Cutting, Piercing, Radiant, Necrotic and Toxic attacks against the affected creature have disadvantage.  
 • Acid attacks against the affected creature have advantage.  
 • Non-magical weapon attacks have disadvantage against the creature, as do typical unarmed attacks.  
 • Any effect which would heal the affected creature has a 1 in 4 chance not to.  
 • They do not swim in water. They must instead walk on the surface below.

Additionally, you may choose some traits of the metal.  
 • _Weight_. You may have the creature's weight be reduced by up to 1/4, or increased by up to 1/3.  
 • _Thermal Resistance_. You may choose to have either Cold or Fire attacks have disadvantage against the creature. If you do, attacks of the other type gain advantage against it.  
 • _Weight capacity_. You may choose to increase the weight limits of the creature by half at each load level.  
 • _Conductivity_. You may choose to have electric attacks gain advantage or disadvantage against the creature. You may also choose to apply neither.  
 • _Appearance_. You choose the sheen of the metal.  
Once these decisions are made, they can't be changed.

After the spell ends, for a number of hours equal to the total minutes of duration, the affeted creature has a -1 penalty to all [Body] and [Fort] checks/saves and a -1 penalty to all attacks.

A creature may make a [Fort] save to avoid this if they wish.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the duration in minutes is increased. The total duration will be the tier squared.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to transfer the transmutation properly. You gain the benefits of the spell normally until the end of the next round, at which point the metal skin then begins to corrode. At the start of each round, for the remainder of the duration, you must succeed a [Fort] save or become prone for the rest of the spell's duration. Once rusted, it provides protection only like maile.

#### Isevalder

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a mist tailed spirit of nature to strike a foe within range, treat as a biting attack. If the attack would qualify to damage the foe's armor, it instead freezes the foe for half as many rounds as the spell's tier. As a reaction, it can be directed against another foe, inflicting the biting attack. Each round, during the primary action phase, it will attack the creature it was last designated to target with a cold attack.

The spirit ceases to be after a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 2 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The spirit conjured is quite upset with you. It grapples you for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. You cannot fight against this. During the primary action phase while you are grappled, it inflicts a biting attack against you. During the secondary action phase of each such round, it inflicts a cold attack. You are prone during this time.

### J (4

#### Jaunt Macabre

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 9 actions

**Range**: 2 yards

**Effect**:  You think of a corpse or place in your mind while targeting a corpse within range. You may enter the targeted corpse as a means of teleportation to the imagined corpse or a corpse in the imagined area. Both corpses explode and are defiled as a result of you burst through magically. Alternatively, you may allow another creature to travel through the corpse. A corpse must be of the same creature size or larger than a transported creature for the spell to function properly. If multiple creatures are to be transported through a single corpse, the effective size category of a creature entering is increased by the number of creatures which previously entered the corpse.

A corpse must be entered by the end of the next phase or it will not transport the creature. If such transportation is not valid, the spell fails and you receive a point of spell sickness.

If the spellcheck is a critical success, you may have an explosion escape from the destination corpse. This will inflict either a cutting, necrotic, or piercing attack (your choice) to anything within 1 yard (other than the creatures transprted by the spell) per size category.

**At Higher Tiers**: When cast at 3rd tier or greater, for each tier beyond minimum, you may choose one of the following
* The range is increased by 1 yard.
* The casting time is reduced by 1 action.
* The explosion caused by a critical success may be increased by an additional yard per size category and the attacks gain a +1 for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit.
* You may affect an additional corpse to allow an additional crreature to transport. They may exit through the same corpse or a different corpse.

**Critical Failure**: The corpse explodes, inflicting a cutting, necrotic, and piercing attack against you- in order. The cutting attack has disadvantage. If one of thise attacks is successful against you, the following attacks each get an instance of advantage.

#### Jet

**Minimum Tier**: 5

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Effect**: You create a tap to access a supernatural source of damaging fluid, producing a jet of acid 15 yards in a line which is .5 feet high and wide. Everything in the line is subject to an acid attack, which is resolved in the order of nearest (to point of origin) to farthest. This spell can break through intersposing barriers so long as the total thickness is no greater than a number of half feet equal to the spell's tier.

If the spell check is a critical success, you may change the effect of a critical hit by this attack to be that of any one exotic damage type. Additionally, if the attack would qualify to damage armor, it also inflicts an attack of that type.

**At Higher Tiers**: In addition to the benefits noted above, each tier beyond the minimum increases the distance of the jet by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: Your attempt at conjuring the spray has failed horribly. Inflict an acid attack against everything within a number of feet equal to the spell's tier (including yourself), and then a number of acid attacks against yourself equal to half of the spell's tier (round down).


#### Jinx

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 1 yard

**Effect**: You have influenced some force affecting the target, giving them the worst luck possible. Inflict an undamaging attack against the foe.

This lasts for an hour. Each time this causes a critical failure, the penalty is reduced by 1.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum can eiter increases the range by 3 yards or the duration by 1 hour, in addition to the benefit noted above.

**Effect**: You perform an unarmed attack against a foe, which also inflicts a crushing attack against the foe. You may choose to have the crushing attack treated as a sunder. If you do, it is applied before the unarmed attack.

If you have the foe grappled, both attacks gain a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit.

**At Higher Tiers**: The benefits are noted above.

**Critical Failure**: The force you conjure is channeled into your body rather than the foe. The crushing attack is instead inflicted against you, and you become prone for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier.

### K (2

#### Kiss of Death

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Effect**: You transfer to the victim of your touch a surge of deathly menace. You are prone and vulnerable until the end of the phase following when you cast this spell. Upon kissing the target, it must perform an incapacitation save. 

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum increases the DV of the incapacitation save by 1 and the casting time by one action.

**Critical Failure**: You find yourself subject to the forces of the kiss instead, even if you are normally unaffected by incapacitation saves.

#### Know Pain

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to a creature you can perceive within range being attacked

**Range**: 15 yards

**Effect**: You draw insight into the force assailing a creature. You know the total of the attack roll and the attack type. If the attack would be treated as having an alternative critical hit efffect or effect if it qualifies for damaging armor, you know that as well. If the successful attack causes other effects to trigger, you know what effects it triggers.

If the spellcheck is a critical success, you know the precise location of the source of that attack if you can perceive it or it is within range.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may increase the range by 25 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You instead feel some of the pain, making you vulnerable until the end of the round.

### L (4

#### Lafiancy

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 20 rounds

**Range**: 3 yards

**Duration**: A number of rounds equal to the spell's tier squared

**Effect**: You cause some amount of stone whose total volume could fit within a cube whose total volume is X cubic feet (where X is the spells tier squared), to become liquid. It will gradually reharden, starting out like water but becoming a thick pudding halfway through the duration. Alternatively, if the material to be affected is a creature composed of stone, treat as though it were subject to the Hydromorphy spell with the following exceptions;  
• It ignores any form of non-magical Acid, Fire, or Toxic attacks whose total is less than the points of success.  
• Cold and electrical attacks against it have disadvantage.  
• It does not understand Hydroglossa unless it speaks it.  
• The duration of this form cannot exceed the spell's duration.

**At Higher Tiers**: These benefits are listed above.

**Critical Failure**: You have potentially liquified yourself. Inflict unlisted damage attacks against yourself equal to the tier of the spell -1. Then peform a [Fort] save with a DV equal to the points of failure of the spell check. If you fail, you are immobile for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure of the save multiplied by the spells tier. If you die as a result of this spell, your remains are liquified.

[Lafiancy Spell]: # "Derived from old english Lafian."

#### Landing

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take before you would impact with a surface you can perceive while falling or being knocked back

**Range** 3 yards

**Effect**: You mangae to divert some of the force of your impact. Divide the feet you travled as a result of the fall or knockback by the number of other creatures within range. Then apply falling/knockback damage to each creature within range as though all were affected by it. If no other creatures were within range, you simply reduce your fall distance by number of yards equal to the spell's tier + your [Magic] bonus.

A critical success with the spell check will allow you to modify the distance applied to you (after any division of distance) by a number of feet equal to the points of success. 

Alternatively, you could cast this spell in anticpation of coming in contact with a creature travelling as a result of falling/knockback. If you do, and it would be reasonable to assume that you make contact, treat it as the subject of the spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to modify the range of the spell by 1 per tier beyond 2nd.

**Critical Failure**: You instead increase the effect distance of your fall/knockback, in feet, by the points of failure multiplied by the spell's tier. If you cast it on another creature, it is protected from the fall/knockback damage, and you take it instead- including the aforementiond penalty for critically failing the spell check.

#### Lava Axe

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 yards

**Effect**: You create a molten shape, vaguely resembling a throwing axe, which is then hurled at a foe. This inflicts a fire attack against the target. In place of inflicting a normal critical hit effect, the foe's armor receives 2 damage. If the foe is unarmored, it inflicts the traditional critical hit effect.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum sees the attack gain a +1 bonus.

**Critical Failure**: The axe explodes infront of you, inflicting the effect against you instead.

#### Levitation

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 rounds

**Duration**: Minutes equal to the spell's tier squared

**Effect**: A creature you touch may defy physics by gaining a hover speed of 3 yards for the duration. If the spell check is a critical success, the speed is increased by a number of feet equal to your [Magic] bonus.

You may cast this on an object to make it hover at a distance above the ground no greater than the spell's tier plus the points of success on the spell check. An object can hover beyond the spell's duration if you concentrate on the spell, with it hovering until this concentration is broken.

**At Higher Tiers**: In addition to the above listed benefits, each tier beyond minimum allows you to affect an additional creature/object or increase the hover speed by .5 yard.

**Critical Failure**: You and whatever you intended on affecting begin to float but do not possess the level of control as expected. Each affected creature is prone and vulnerable, with the speed given by this spell measured in inches, not yards. This state continues for a number of rounds equal to the points of success multiplied by this spell's tier. You gain a point of spell sickness for each other creature you had sought to affect when casting this spell.

### M (7

#### Metamogrify

**Minimum Tier**: 4

**Casting Time**: 25 actions

**Range**: 1 yard

**Duration**: 6 minutes

**Effect**: You force a change in form of a creature within range. Choose one of the following to affect the creature;  
* The creature increases in size category by 1. The creature gets a bonus equal to double the spell tier to its save against this spell. The spell's duration is reduced to 1/3.
* The creature decreases in size category by 1. The creature gets a bonus equal to double the spell tier to its save against this spell. The spell's duration is reduced to 1/2.
* Choose one of its unarmed attacks that inflicts one of the following types of attacks (bare, club, cutting, force, piercing, thrown blade) and replace it with another such damage type.
* Choose one of following movement sppeds possessed by the creature (run, climb, swim, flying). You increase or decrease it (your choice) by a number of feet equal to the spell's tier +1. This may be selected multiple times if cast at a higher tier (see below).
* The creature becomes vulnerable.
* The creature becomes prone.
* The creature receives a level of fatigue.

 It is allowed a [Fort] save to prevent this, with a DV equal to the spellcheck's points of success + triple spell tier. A critical success with the spell check allows you to select an additional option with the spell. This spell cannot affect ephemera.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may choose one of the following,  
* The range is increased by 3 yards.
* The casting time is reduced by 1 action (to a minimum of 1 action)
* Choose an additional option with the spell, it is also applied.
* The duration is increased by 1 minute.

**Critical Failure**: You instead affect yourself, but suffer a penalty to all checks and saves equal to the spell's tier for the duration of the spell. You cannot make a save to prevent this.

#### Meteor

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a meteor which either appears to be hurled by you or is called forth from the sky to be directed to a foe within range. Upon impact, it inflicts a force attack against the foe. It then explodes, inflicting a force attack against all creatures (including the target) within 2 yards. If any attack from this would qualify to damage armor against a foe, it inflicts an additional attack. This additional attack is a cold attack if hurled from you or a fire attack if rained from above.

If the spell check is a critical success, the initial hit will also apply the effect of a critical hit of the appropriate bonus type (cold or fire) so long as the attack is successful.

**At Higher Tiers**: When cast at 4th tier or greater, for each tier beyond minimum, you may increase the range of the explosion by 1 yard or the range by 3 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The meteor is instead targeting you. The initial attack gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purposes of inflicting a critical hit.

#### Mindless Command

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Effect**: Using a combination of metaphysical forces and a spark of psychic energy, you bestow a mindless creature you touch with a missive or order, which can take the form of a single word, that is accompanied by a gesture.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier above minimum, you may increase the range by 5 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You have managed to attract the attention of the creature you sought to command. For a number of days equal to the points of failure, it will attempt to destroy you in any way they can. So long as you still have spell sickness during this time, it gains a bonus to its attacks for the purposes of determing if they are a critical hit and gains a bonus to opposed checks against you, with both bonuses being equal to the spell's tier. Additionally, during this time, it will know the general direction towards you- but not how far exactly.

#### Missiles of Light

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 2 actions + 1 action per missile

**Range**: 25 yards

**Effect**: You produce up to 2 bolts of light which each strike a different target of your choice within range, inflicting radiant attacks. If an attack would qualify to damage a foe's armor, it instead blinds them for a number of rounds equal to the tier of the spell. Multiple missiles may be combined into a unified attack against a foe. If so, only a single attack roll is made but it gains a +1 bonus for each additional missile which was combined this way.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to either increase the maximum number of missiles by 1, grant a +2 for the purpose of determining a critical hit with all attacks from the spell, or increase the range by 5 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You hurl the bolts of light, and as they scatter, the redirect themselves against you. Any combined missiles remain so. Each missile is staggered, with only one attacking each phase until each has had its turn (you may determine the order in which they attack you).

[Missiles of Light Spell]: # " Created at the request of Michael Hasty, who wanted a spell that produced 'missiles of light' which 'could blind'. This turned out to be a misunderstanding, so the Flare spell is also to be made."

#### Molten Form

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 1 yard

**Duration**: 1 minute

**Effect**: You transmute a creature, granting it a fiery aura and skin like molten rock. This confers a few changes to the creature  

 • Cannot be affected by fire in any manner.  
 • Cannot wear armor. Any flammable armor they are wearing is burnt up. They are treated as wearing brigandine.  
 • They do not receive damage from being crushed (including crushing attacks), falling, or knockback- but instead become dazed and prone for a number of rounds equal to the attack(s) total.  
 • Cold attacks against them have disadvantage and cause them to be prone for a number of rounds equal to the attack total. This is cumulative.  
 • Critical hits of Cold and Crushing attacks leave the subject vulnerable until the end of the round, even if the subject would not be wounded by it.  
 • Every round the subject spends at least half submerged in water reduces its move speeds by 1 foot until it spend twice as much time dry. This is cumulative. Once the subject's last mode of movement is reduced to 0 this way, it loses the ability to move at all until the appropriate amount of time has been spent dry.  
 • The subject puts off light like a torch.  
 • Any effect which would heal the subject has a 1 in 4 chance not to.  
 • They do not swim in water, instead walking on the surface below.

A creature may make a [Fort] save to avoid this if they wish.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may affect an additional creature and the range is increased to a number of yards equal to the spell's tier.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to transfer the transmutation properly. Yourself and any affected creature is set ablaze, as though a fire attack inflicted a critical hit. The save DV will be equal to the DV of the spell check.

#### Moonfire

**Minimum Tier**: 4

**Casting Time**: 2 Actions

**Effect**: When you cast this spell, choose one of the following damage types (cold, electric, fire, radiant, necrotic). You conjure a jet of glowing silvery blue flame stretching out 5 yards. It is up to .5 foot wide and equally tall. Anything in the area suffers a fire attack, then a ki attack, then an attack of the chosen type. If an attack would qualify to damage armor it does not, and instead afflicts the foe with either a point of inebriation or spell sickness (your choice when casting the spell). In place of traditional critical hit effects, each critical hit instead inflicts an instance of Archeblight.

If the spellcheck is a critical success, you may change the shape to be a cone or inverted cone- but the total length is reduced by 1/3.

This spell cannot be cast in sunlight. Attacks from this spell have a -2 penalty if user is not in moonlight when casting the spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum allows you to propel the flames 1.5 yards further.

**Critical Failure**: You and every creature within a number of feet equal to your [Magic] bonus + 3 are subject to a ki attack and an attack of the selected type. The attacks each gain a bonus against you equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of determining a critical hit. These are standard magical attacks.

#### Mortal Masque

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 1 yard

**Duration**: 1 hour

**Effect**: You magically reform the flesh of a corpse to appear as though it did in life. This can be applied to a reanimated corpse of some nature, but it must be able to cooperate for this.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may increase the duration by an hour. Alternatively, if cast as a 3rd tier or higher spell, you may halve the total duration to have the corpse formed to appear as any member of the same species so long as your are familiar with that subject or have a detailed reference.

**Critical Failure**: You have managed deform it beyond recognition. You also receive additional points of spell-sickness equal to 1d3+half of the spell's tier.

### N (2 

#### Nightburn

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 9 yards

**Effect**: You produce an unnaturally colored flame which does not seem to emit light. You may psychically move this flame during each movement phase up to a number of yards equal to the spell's tier. You may also use your reaction to move the spell a number of yards equal to the tier + your [Magic] bonus. The flame must remain in range of you, and you must maintain concentration on it, or it ceases to exist.

The flame is not automatically snuffed out by water or other liquids, but can be extinquished by light. If it is exposed to fair light for a number of consecutive phases equal to the spell's tier- it is extinquished. Each phase in bright light is treated as 1d4 phases.

If the flame is directed into an object or creature, it inflicts a fire attack.

**At Higher Tiers**: The benefits for casting at higher times is noted above

**Critical Failure**: You fail to ignite the flame properly, inflicting an attack roll against yourself. If the attack roll is odd, its a fire attack. If even, necrotic. It gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit against you.

#### Nralling

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 15 rounds

**Range**: 3 yards

**Effect**: You conjure an entity from a shadowy realm known as a Nral. It materializes within range. You may command it psychically for 3 minutes. Afterwards, it will no longer be bound by the spell and becomes hostile. It ceases to be after 6 minutes or when it would be destroyed normally.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the Nral's hitpoints are increased by 1. Additionally the time it exists under your purview and the time it exists afterwards is increased by a minute each. The casting time is increased by 2 rounds for each tier beyond minimum.

**Critical Failure**: The spell seems to function as normal, but it only remains subservient to you for a number of rounds equal to your [Magic] bonus minus the spell's tier (minimum of 1 round).

### O (4

#### Oozery

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 3 yards

**Effect**: You create a microscopic forcefield around an amorphous creature you can perceive in range of small size or smaller. While an amorphous creature is within this forcefield, you can have it move at its normal speed during the movement phase by using your reaction or forfeiting your movement. Alternatively, you may treat it as having a levitation speed in feet equal to the spell's tier + your [Magic] bonus. You may prevent the creature from moving in any capacity, though it can use its action to attempt a [Body] check with a DV equal to the spellcheck's points of success + spell tier to break the forcefield.

The forcefield prevents contact between the creature and anything else. The caster must concentrate on the spell to maintain it. A critical success with the spellcheck will prevent the target from being able to break free.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows the caster one of the following benefits,  
* The range is increased by 2 yards
* The spell now lasts until the end of the round that concentration is lost, if you wish.
* If the above option was chosen, the spell lasts an additional whole round after concentration is lost.
* The size of creature you can affect is increased by 1 size category.
* You may affect an additional creature with this spell.

**Critical Failure**: You instead create a forcefield around yourself for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier +1. This causes you to be immobile. Despite being unable to move, which might incur the vulnerable condition, the forcefield's protective qualities mitigate that.

#### Oozing Sphere

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Duration**: Minutes equal to the spell's tier

**Effect**: You create a sphere whose appearence is at your discretion on a surface you can touch. The size of this sphere is at least 1 foot in diameter, but can be up to a number of feet equal to the spell's tier + [Magic] bonus. This sphere moves in a direction of your choice at a speed of at least 2 yards per move, but no greater then a number of yards equal to the tier of the spell. If the surface bends more than 45 degrees, the sphere "drops" from the surface (having lost its grip) or impacts (if it is already rolling on the ground). The sphere leaves a trail of mucous everywhere it goes. Once the sphere impacts against something, it implodes. This spews acid everywhere for a number of yards equal to spell tier + 1d3. This acid has disadvantage on creatures with the Mucous feature. If the sphere never impacts, it never implodes and simply leaves that mucous behind.

On a critical success with your spellcheck, you may have the spell end at a set time before the normal end of duration, deciding so before the sphere begins to travel.

An attack on the sphere is successful with an attack total of 5 or mroe and will cause it to explode, spewing acid against everything within a number of feet equal to spell tier + 1d4.

**At Higher Tiers**: The benefits for higher tiers is noted above.

**Critical Failure**: The sphere doesn't form correctly and instantly explodes, inflicting an acid attack against you with a bonus equal to the spell tier for the purpose of determining a critical hit and leaving mucous on everything else within 1 yard.

#### Orbiting Guard

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Duration**: 5 rounds

**Effect**: Select an exotic damage type. You create 2 glowing motes that orbit around you in swirling patterns. Each mote produces dim light out for an inch, just enough for them to be visible in the dark but not enough to see anything else. For the duration of the spell, when you are attacked you may use your reaction to do one of the following;  
* Attempt to reduce the impact with a mote. The mote provides a 1d4 bonus to defense- which is increased to 1d6 against attacks of the same type (the type you selected when casting the spell).
* Attempt to retialiate with a mote, flinging it at the source of that attack if it is within 10 yards.
* Detonate a mote, casuing an explosion that inflicts an attack against all within 1 foot (including yourself). You gain a bonus to defense against the attack equal to the spell's tier.

Additionally, while brawling with a foe, you may have the mote inflict a normal attack or detonate as above by using your reaction. The single attack suffers a penalty for brawling but not the attack from the explosion.

When the duration expires, the motes fade from existance. When a mote is used, it ceases to be.

**At Higher Tiers**: When cast at 4th tier or greater, for each tier beyond minimum, you may choose one of the following;  
* The duration is increased by 5 rounds
* The range you may fling the mote in retaliation is increased by 5 yards
* The range of the explosion may be uincreased by up to 2 feet (you decide when detonating)
* You produce an additional mote

**Critical Failure**: You create the motes as though the spell functions normally. Anytime you perform an action or reaction, one of them explodes. You do not gain a bonus against the mote and instead the explosion gain a bonus against you equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit.

#### Oscillating Wave

**Range**: 2 yards

**Effect**: You have harnessed some supernatural force. If the attack resolves in a way that inflicts a wound against you, it also inflicts a wound against that creature. The wound die result for both yourself and the other creature will be the same die roll result. If either you or the opposing creature do not receive wounds, the spell will fail unless you use the same alternative (such as creature's of undeath losing points of undeath)- in which case it is considered that an attack of identical nature has been inflicted upon the other creature.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the range by 2 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You have failed to call upon the power needed for this, granting the attack a bonus against you equal to the spell's tier. You also gain spell sickness equal to the spell's tier.

#### Phasic Wave

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 1 foot

**Effect**: You cause a wave of energy to emit from the point in range you designate, extending into a 10 yard fan. Anything caught within the fan suffers a psychic attack. After 1d4 rounds, at the end of the round, energy manifests in the exact same manner- causing a psychic attack against anything within an indentical fan occupying the same space as the first.

**At Higher Tiers**:  Each tier beyond its minimum allows you to increease the level of the d4 die (to a d6, then a d8, etc, until it reachs a d12) and/or increase the size of the fan by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: You unintentionally localize the energy... inside of you. You suffer a psychic attack with advantage. After 1d12 rounds, a sphere of energy explodes out from you a number of feet equal to the spell tier. Everything in the sphere suffers a psychic attack, including yourself.

#### Plasma Ray

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 50 yards

**Effect**: You conjure an unstable source of energy and direct it as a ray at a foe within range. This inflicts a radiant attack against the target. If the attack is a critical hit, it also inflicts the critical hit effect of an electric attack and a fire attack.

**Critical Failure**: The conjured plasma is unstable, inflicting a a radiant attack against you and an additional attack. If the additional attack roll is even, its an electric attack. If odd, its a fire attack. The radiant attack gains a bonus against you equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit.

#### Portalence

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 action or reaction

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You open or close a portal (a door, window, container, etc) of a non-magical nature. You may lock/unlock any number of non-magical locks attached to the portal. A barre (or other lock which can run the entiry of one of the portal's dimensions) cannot be affected by this spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: If cast as second tier or beyond, you may lock/unlock any number of barres to the door. The spell can undo a magical lock of a spell whose tier is half or less of this spell's. Each tier beyond 1st also doubles the range of the spell.

**Critical Failure**: You have jammed the portal in such a way that it cannot function as you intended when casting the spell (opening or closing). If you sought to undo any locks or barres, they are instead fixed shut by the spell and vice versa. This last for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure times the spell's tier.

#### Probe

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 9 actions

**Effect**: You attempt to steal knowledge from another creature with your touch. You learn a single piece of knowledge it possess unless it can succeed an opposed [Will] check. A critical failure by the caster on the opposed check will alert the creature to an attempt to pry into its mind.

If your spellcheck was a critical success, you may add your [Magic] bonus to your oppsed check.

A mindless creature is immune to this, but you will learn of its mindless nature and, if the spellcheck was a critical success, learn its current [Will] score.

**At Higher Tiers**: When cast at higher tiers, you may choose one of the following
* If cast at 4th tier or higher, the casting time is reduced by 1 action per tier beyond minimum (minimum of 1 action).
* If cast at 4th tier or higher, the spell gains a range in yards equal to the spell's tier.
* If cast at 4th tier or higher, you instead know what languages the creature speaks/understands. Choose one, you learn that language for a number of minutes equal to the spell's tier. No [Will] check is required for this casting.

* If cast at 5th tier or higher, you instead know the name of every spell that creature knows unless it succeeds the opposed [Will] save. Choose one of those spells whose tier is less then half of this spell's. For a number of rounds equal to this spell's tier, you can identify the spell as though you knew it and may attempt to cast or counterspell the chosen spell as though you knew it.

**Critical Failure**: You have tipped your hand. The creature is aware of your prying. It knows what you attempted to learn. If you used an alternative function of the spell by casting it at a higher tier, it instead applies the effect against you. Additionally, you are exposed to two psychic attacks. The first attack gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit. The second gains a bonus equal to the target's [Will] bonus for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 15 yards

**Effect**: You attempt the difficult task of seperating a creature's very consciousness temporarily, an art not easily mastered nor ever recommended. Target must succeed an [Inte] save or become dazed for a number of rounds equal to half of the points of failure. On a critical failure, the creature becomes Mindless° for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier before becoming dazed.  

You may cast this on a creature that is already mindless. If it critically fails the save, it forgets any orders it had received and cannot receive any for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier.

° They do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing effects and fear-based effects.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may increase the range by 10 or the duration of the daze by 1d6 rounds

**Critical Failure**: So long as you have spell sickness, you are mindless.

#### Psychoburst

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You produce an unstable portal connected to the psychic energy of a non-mindless creature within range. This inflicts a psychic attack against the target that does not wound them (though the effects of a critical hit still occur). Instead, an explosion of psychic energy which extends out a number of yards equal to the spell's tier, inflicting a psychic attack against anything in the explosion other than your target. The attacks gain a bonus equal to the target's [Inte] bonus divided by the number of creatures in the explosion radius other than the target. Attacks from the explosion have disadvantage against mindless creatures unless they are connected to the psychic plane.  
Regardless of the spell's effect, if it is cast successfully, the caster knows the target's exact [Inte] score.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range at which you can reach a target is increased by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: Yourself and the target receive a normal psychic attack as you unintentionally cause an unstable psychic conncetion.

**Effect**: You surround your fists (or some oher part of your body) so that it exhudes magical energy. Choose a means of unarmed attack to be affected by this spell. Attacks made by that means can be treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming protective features. Additionally, you choose a damage type when casting this spell. When making an attack roll with the unarmed attack, if the attack roll result is odd, it is treated as the selected damage type. Regardless, a critical hit will always apply the standard effect of the unarmed attack and that of the chosen damage type.

You cannot use items with any body part affected this way.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may either increase the duration by 5 rounds or reduce the casting time by 1 action (to a minimum of 1 action).

**Critical Failure**: You channel the magical energy but fail to control it, an attack of the chosen type is inflicted against you of the chosen type with a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of determining a critical hit.

#### Regeneration

**Minimum Tier**: 5

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Effect**: You touch a creature which has remained within a yard of you the entire time you cast the spell. It performs an incapacitation save which gains a bonus equal to the number of remaining hitpoints it currently has divided by the number of wounds it currently has. If the check is succesful, you heal a wound of your choice from the creature. If it is a critical success, it also recovers a hitpoint or an instance of hemorhaging (your choice as caster).  
Failure on the save does not harm the creature in anyway, but a critical failure prevents the creature from being affected by another Regeneration from the same caster of an equal or lower tier in the same day.

**At Higher Tiers**: For every tier beyond minimum, the save is made with a +1 bonus and increases the casting time by 1 minute.

**Critical Failure**: You must perform an incapacitation save with a penalty equal to the spell's tier. A critical failure will not kill you, but you will receive a wound.

#### Remit

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 7 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Duration**: 2 hours divided by the spell's tier.

**Effect**: You cause the effect of gravity on the mass of a creature/object you target within range, cause ings effective weight to be divided by up to half of the spell's tier. It functions in all other respects that same. A critical success from the spellcheck can grant the benefits of an additional spell tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may increase the duration by half an hour (before dividing per the spell tier) or have the range is increased by 5 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You accidentally effect yourself, but suffer a level of fatigue in the process.

#### Resend

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to a spell producing a ray or the ranged attack of a wand or staff within range

**Range**: 5 Yards

**Effect**: You redirect a magical ray, whose origin or destination is within range, back to its source. This cannot redirect a ray of a spell whose tier is at least half of this spell's.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum increases the range by 3 yards or grants a +1 bonus to the redirected ray's attack roll.

**Critical Failure**: You direct the ray towards yourself, granting it a bonus to its attack roll equal to this spell's tier.

#### Resilireism

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to a successful exotic attack against you

**Effect**: You produce a form of energy appropriate to that damage type, drawn from the residual energy of the attack, shaped into a melee weapon of your choice so long as its weight does not exceed 3 pounds. The weapon functions as normal, except the attack type inflicted is that of the original attack's damage type. The weapon can parry attacks of the same exotic type.

The weapon exists for a number of rounds equal to the points of success with the spellcheck. Another creature attempting to handle the weapon has an attack of its energy type inflicted upon them with disadvantage.

A critical success allows you to create a thrown weapon or piece of munition instead.

**At Higher Tiers**: If cast at 2nd tier or higher, for each tier beyond minimum, the maximum weight of a weapon which may be produced by the spell is increased by 2 pounds.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to properly draw the disapating energy of the attack. Instead, for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier, attacks of that type gain advantage against you.

#### Rotword

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 3 Yards

**Effect**: You speak foul words which can manifest fetid wounds against a foe's flesh. Target foe within range suffers a necrotic attack. This has disadvantage against a creature that cannot hear you and the spell does not work if you cannot express the words (or equivalent sounds). The foe need not understand the words to be subject to them.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum increases the range by 3 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You words fail to produce their intended meaning and the fumbling causes great dissonance to yourself, leaving you vulnerable for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure or until an ally spends an action helping you come to your senses.

### S (17

#### Sapiafi

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 4 yards

**Effect**: You reach out into the psychic plane, getting a sense of every mind within range. You know the exact location of every non-mindless creature within range (even on the psychic and ethereal planes). You also know how many (and which) of those creatures have an [Inte] score of at least 10 (but not the exact score). You know all of this until the end of the next round.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the time you possess this knowledge is increased by an additional round and the range of the spell is increased by 1.5 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You have reached into the psychic plane and found something you cannot understand. You are dazed as long as you have spell sickness and are subject to a psychic attack with bonus equal to the tier of the spell.

#### Seclusion Circle

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Effect**: You produce a magical circle, filled with some incomprehensible fomrulae, which stretches out between 1 and 5 yards- either on the ground or the ceiling. The circle lasts for a number of days equal to the spell's tier.

Anything inside of the circle is incapable of influencing anything outside of the circle. This includes cast spells, using wands or other magic items, or the magical aspects of some feature. This circle can affect something regardless of how high or low from the circle it is, so long as no structure exists between them.

You may use your reaction to knockback a creature in the circle by 1d6 + spell tier feet. If it was trying to leave, you may choose to prevent the knockback from causing it to leave the circle. 

You may designate a material. A creature may use this material to dispel the circle by entering with it.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, allows you to increase the circle by up to 2 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You find yourself trapped in the circle, unable to leave it.

#### Sentinel

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 8 actions

**Range**: 3 yards

**Duration**: 1 minute or concentration (your choice when casting)

**Effect**: You create a glowing sphere of energy and choose a damage type from the following (Acid, Cold, Cutting, Electric, Fire, Force, Piercing, Radiant, Necrotic) within range. The sphere is small enough to fit in one's hand and can levitate up to 2 yards into the air. While it is active, so long as you can perceive the intended target, you may use your bonus action to produce a ray attack against them of the chosen type. This is treated identically to a wand attack. The sphere puts out dim light for half a foot and does not move on its own. 

If you can perceive it, you may use your action to guide it up to a number of feet equal to the spell's tier. You may also use your action to "set" it, causing it to fire on the next thing to enter its range or to move within its range (your choice). Such a thing must be illuminated in at least dim light to be visible to the sphere. It will ignore you for this purpose.

If the spellcheck was a critical success, you may have the sentinel gain an additional effect depending on the damage type you chose.  
* Acid: Anything below the sentinel is subjact to an acid attack at the end of each round as acid rythmically drips from the sphere. When the spell ends, you may have the sentinel explode, inflicting an acid attack against anyting within a number of half-feet equal to the spell's tier.
* Cold: Instead of potentially damaging armor, the sentinel's attack freezes a foe for a number of phases equal to the spell's tier -1.
* Cutting: The sphere can also attack in melee. When it does so, blades spin around it to inflict a cutting attack against everything within a number of half-feet equal to the spell's tier.
* Electric: Instead of potentially damaging armo, the attack arcs, inflicting an electric attack against the nearst creature within a number of yards equal to the spell's tier- even if it is not illuminated. A creature struck by any attack from this sentinel, including an arced attack, cannot be struck by an arced attack in the same phase.
* Fire: The sentinel puts out light like a torch. When the spell ends, you may have it explode. Anything within 1 foot must succeed a [Rflx] save with DV of 10+spell tier or be set ablaze as though by a critical hit from a fire attack.
* Force: A struck creature is knocked back a number of half-feet equal to the spell's tier +1.
* Piercing: The attacks of the sentinel can pierce through a struck foe in a straight line, potentially hitting other creatures.
* Radiant: The sentinel produces bright or fairlight (your choice) out a number of yards equal to the spell's tier, fair light out for a number of yards beyond that equal to the spell's tier, and dim light beyond that for a number of yards equal to the spell's tier.
* Necrotic: When the spell ends, you may have it explode, inflicting a necrotic attack against everything within a number of feet equal to the spell's tier -1.

**At Higher Tiers**: As seen above, a higher tier provides several benefits.

**Critical Failure**: The create the sentinel, but it seems to have a mind of its own. It will attempt to attack you during each action phase. In addition, it can attempt to attack the nearest creature to it at the end of each movement phase. A creature must be illuminated in at least dim light for the sphere to see it, but does not require that light to attack you. The sentinel always lasts for a minute this way.

#### Set Breath

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You manage to bestow up to two creatures in range an extended reserve of air. For a number of rounds equal to 2d8 plus double the Spell Tier, the creature need not breathe normally. This is rolled for each creature individually. A creature will know this effect is to expire at the start of the final round.

If a creature breathes another medium than air, the spell adjusts for that so long as it is cast in the appropriate medium.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may increase the time for each creature by 1d12 + spell tier or affect an additional creature.

**Critical Failure**: You struggle to breathe properly for a number of rounds equal to double the spell's tier- making you vulnerable during that time. If you do not breathe normally, you instead gain 1d4 points of spell sickness.

#### Shackling Order

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a magical binding at a foe within range, treat as an undamaging attack. If successful, the creature is prone and grappled by the bindings. The creature may attempt a [Body] check with a DV equal to the spellcheck's points of success plus the spell's tier. A success breaks the grappling effect of the bindings, but still leaves them prone as some of it remains intact. A critical success breaks the spell completely. A critical failure causes them to suffer a -4 penalty to further such checks until the end of the next round. A failure yields no result. Each round, the DV of the check required is reduced by 1 until it reach 0, at which point the bindings cease to exist.

A critical success with the undamaging attack disallows the attempts to break free during the same round.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 3 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You fumble with the bindings and bind yourself with this spell instead, pending the undamaging attack of course. The DV becomes the points of failure plus the spell's tier.

#### Silent Alarm

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 10 actions

**Range**: 50 yards

**Effect**: You magically mark a set point, up to 1 square foot, or a single portal (such as a door, window, or the opening of a container) you touch to alert you psychically if disturbed. In the case of a specific point, it is disturbed if something comes in contact with it. In the case of a portal, it is disturbed if opened or closed. Alternatively, you may have the spell psychically connected to an arcane device instead of yourself.

Once disturbed, if you are within the alarm's range, you will be alerted to the intrusion (or the possessor of the arcane device).

This spell last a day.

**At Higher Tiers**: If cast as second tier or beyond, the alarm can last a number of days equal to the points of success. Each tier beyond 1st also increases the area you may have alarmed. The total area is a number of square feet equal to the spell's tier squared.

**Critical Failure**: You seem to have set the alarm just fine. The alarm does nothing when disturbed though.

#### Sludgery

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You throw an acidic substance created on the spot at a foe within range, inflicting an acid attack. If foe is armored, this is a sunder. If the attack would qualify to damage armor, it instead sticks to the foe- making them prone until it can be washed off or they spend an action to succeed a [Body] check with a DV equal to the spellcheck's points of success to break the sludge.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum sees the attack gain a +1 bonus.

**Critical Failure**: Your attempt at creating the acid far exceeded your ability to direct it. The spell instead affects you and gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of determinng if it is a critical hit.

#### Sobering

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Effect**: You touch a creature in an attempt to help clear its mind. Reducing its inebriation by 1d4 points. A critical success allows you to remove 1d6 instead.

Everything in the line is subject to a necrotic attack, which is resolved in the order of nearest (to point of origin) to farthest. For each creature other than one of an exlcuded type mentioned below which has been successfully wounded by this spell, the attack gains a +1 bonus. A creature killed as a result of this spell (including a failed incapacitation save caused by the spell) provides a further +1 to further attacks in the same instance of this spell. A creature of undeath successfully struck by this spell loses additional points of undeath equal to the spell's tier.

Excluded creatures include Constructs, Elementals, Ephemera, Fiends, and Undead. These creatures still suffer an attack (with any accrued bonuses) but do not contribute any additional bonus to further attacks from the spell, even if destroyed this way.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum allows you to send the wave 1 yard further.

**Critical Failure**: You have tapped into something you shouldn't. Inflict a number of necrotic attacks against yourself equal to half of this spell's tier and a nectrotic attack against every creature (including yourself) within 3 yards of a non-excluded type. The attacks against you gain a bonus for the purpose of determining a critical hit equal to the spell's tier.

#### Spectral Burst

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You produce a striking spray of radiant color, inflicting a radiant attack against the foe. On a critical hit, you may have the target emit light like a torch for a number of rounds equal to the points of success. A foe emitting light this way cannot be hidden in any visual manner, including invisbility. Furthermore, your attacks against that foe gain a +1 bonus while they glow in this manner. You may choose the color of the struck foe's glow when they are hit.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack.

**Critical Failure**: You produce a flash of light, blinding yourself until your spell sicknesss recovers. Additionally, you glow a shifting hue, as though you had been affected by the spell, for a number of minutes equal to the spell's tier. The hue varies as time goes on.

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 30 yards

**Effect**: You produce a sphere which displaces the ambient thermal enegry in its space, a sphere extending 3 yards from the point your designated. When the spell is cast, the sphere deals a cold attack against each creature within the sphere. All non-magical flames inside the sphere are extinguished, as are the flames of spells whose tier is less then half of this spell's, and non-magical liquids are frozen. The sphere lasts for a number of rounds equal to the points of success on the spell check. Any creature that enters the sphere suffers a cold attack. A creature which ends the round in the sphere also receives a cold attack.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum sees the sphere extend out an additional foot in all directions.

**Critical Failure**: Flip a coin. If tails, you produce the sphere centered on you lasting for a single round. Regardless, you are completely frozen (see condition).

#### Spritzery

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 5 Actions

**Duration**: 1 + [Magic] bonus minutes

**Effect**: You project a strange foaming fluid in a 5 yard line, which is .5 foot high and wide. Choose two different exotic damage types, one for protection and one for vulnerability. Anything within the line is covered in a strange concoction of your making for the duration of the spell. Attacks of the type choosen for protection have disadvantage against someone covered. Attacks of the type chosen for vulnerability have advantage against something covered this way. You may choose to spray a cone instead of a line, ut this reduces the range to one third.

A critical success with the spell check will allow you to produce an additional line as an action so long as there is still duration to the spell.

A creature's Mucous feature protects it from this.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to extend the range of the spell's line by 1 yard or the duration by 1 minute.

**Critical Failure**: You manage to spray yourself with a strange fluid. Make a [Fort] save with a DV equal to the points of failure + the spell's tier. Attacks of both chosen types have advantage against you for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure.


#### Starfall

**Minimum Tier**: 6

**Casting Time**: 20 actions

**Range**: 100 yards

**Effect**: You designate a 17 yard by 17 yard space within range. After 1d10 rounds, this spell calls down a number of magical projectiles, which fall like meteors, equal to the d10 result + the spell's tier + [Magic] bonus. Divide the projectiles by the number of creatures in the area, rounding down. This is the number of attacks made against each creature within the space. An even attack roll is a radiant attack and an odd attack roll is a ki attack. If there was a fraction, the caster may use their reaction to direct an additional such attack against a creature they can perceive within the area.

If the spell check was a critical success, you may replace the d10 with any of the following dice (d4, d6, d8, d12). The number of attacks inflicted is still reflected by this change.

**At Higher Tiers**: In addition to the above mentioned benefit, each tier beyond minimum can afford one of the following benefits;  
* Range is increased by 15 yards
* Number of total attacks generated is increased by 1
* area of effect is increased or reduced by 2 yards in both dimensions.
* Casting time is reduced by 2 actions

**Critical Failure**: You conjure the starfall over yourself, wherever you are when it resolves. You count as a number of creatures equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of determining how many attacks are directed at you. For example, a 5th tier spell will attack you as 5 individual creatures- potentially causing a great number of attacks against you.

#### Stupify

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You inflict a psychic attack against a creature within range. In place of inflicting a wound, it receives points of inebriation equal to the spell's tier. The attack still inflicts a critical hit's effect as normal.

If it impacts, the sphere explodes causing anything within 5 yards to be subject to the explosion. The explosion will, in order; perform a radiant attack, a fire attack, and an electric attack against anything caught. If an attack is successful in any degree, it grants the next attack advantage.

Against Eldritch, Elemental, and Fey creatures, the spell cannot inflict a critical hit. Against undead, each attack gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purposes of determining if the attack is a critical hit.

The globe can stop at the directed point and hover in place. While active this way, the globe shines bright light for 50 yards, fair light for 100 yards beyond that, and dim light for 150 yards beyond that. This light also dispels magical darkness of a lower tier within the area it illuminates.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum can either increase the range of the sphere's journey by 25 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The sphere doesn't stablize as it forms, causing it to detonate in your grasp. The attacks from the spell gain a bonus against you equal to the spell's tier. Additionally, anything within range must succeed a DV 18 [Prcp] or [Rflx] save or be blinded for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure. You are instead blinded for a number of hours equal to the points of failure. Even if you succeed your save, you will be blind for a number of minutes equal to the spell's tier.

The water disappears almost as quickly as it appears, lasting a minute per spell tier. Attempts at collecting this water can only yield a single serving per spell tier.  
In addition, counterspell checks made within the area of this rain suffer a penalty equal to this spell's tier.
Cannot be cast at night.

**At Higher Tiers**: These benefits are noted above.

**Critical Failure**: You receive 1d4 points of spell sickness as things don't quite seem right. This die is icreased by one step for each tier beyond minimum it was cast, if applicable.

#### Swift Bolt

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You attempt to create a tether of controlled ions which become charged, inflicting an electrical attack against the foe. If it is not Elemental, Ephemera, Fey, or Undead, it is not wounded and instead prone and vulnerable until the end of the next round. It can still be subject to the effect of a critical hit.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum sees the range increase by 3 yards. 

**Critical Failure**: You fail to ground yourself aginst the charge of the tether, causing yourself to be afflicted by the attack instead. The attack gains a +1 bonus against you for each tier beyond first.

**Duration**: 1 hour

**Effect**: A creature you touch becomes enchanted in such a way that it treats clouds, and thick vapourous substances (like a harsh fog or smoke) as a solid object. this cause it to be able to stand atop such a material and potential form it, but also causes it to function like a barrier to it.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the duration by 2 hours.

**Critical Failure**: You have managed to really mess up the enchantment. The subject is prone for 1d4 rounds times the spell's tier and you are petrified for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier as a msyterious fog encases around you.

### T (8

#### Telekinesis 

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You magically grasp an object weighing no more than 2 stones (28 pounds) within range. You can move it up to a number of feet equal to the spellcheck's points of success.

You may concentrate on the spell, This allows you to move it on movement phases so long as you perform no other actions and maintain concentration. If an object is capable of moving or being moved this way, subtract the macimum distance you can move the object by an amount equal to that movemnt, but the other movement is not applied. If the other movement would be greater than the maximum movement you can move the object- your grasp is broken and you have no affect on the object.

A creature can be moved this way but counts as triple its weight.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum can either increase the range, increase the distance the object can be moved, or increase the weight.  
If increase range, it is increased by a number of yards equal to the spellcheck's point of success.  
If increasing the distance the object is moved, it is increased by a number of feet equal to the spellcheck's points of success.  
If increasing the maximum weight of the object moved, the new weight maximum (measured in stones) is equal to 1 + additional tiers devoted this way, squared.

**Duration**: 1 Hour

**Effect**: You touch a creature's mouth or other noise making orface. For the duration of the spell, you can hear any noise made from that orface as though it were right next to your ear. At any point, you may drop the spell's effect. Anytime you or the subject are wounded while the spell is active, there is a 5% chance the spell drops automatically.

Clearly, a creature already incapable of hearing has no benefit from this spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the duration by 1 hour.

**Critical Failure**: You seem to cast it correctly, but the moment you hear something from the subject- you become deafened for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure multiplied by the spell's tier.

#### Tell Undead

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You psychically give an undead creature you can perceive a missive or order, which can take the form of a single sentence, that is accompanied by a word or a gesture. It must succeed a [Will] save or follow through with it so long as it does not violate its own moral tenets. Whatever is suggested cannot be something whose effect would be greater than a number of hours equal to the spell's tier. This cannot be something that would knowingly cause great harm to it or violate their moral tenets. A mindless creature has disadvantage against this and clearly has no concerns with morality or its own self preservation.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier above minimum, you may target an additional creature within range.

**Critical Failure**: You have managed to attract the attention of those creatures you sought to tell. For a number of days equal to the points of failure, they will attempt to destroy you in any way they can. So long as you still have spell sickness during this time, they gain advantage on their attacks against you. Additionally, during this time, they will know the general direction towards you- but not how far exactly.

#### Temporialysis

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum, other than the above benefits, can do one of the following;  
Improve the die level of the d6 by one.  
THe caster may affect an additional creature through touch. The total time passed this way is divided by 1 + the total number of creatures affected this way.

**Critical Failure**: The time that passess is multiplied by the points of failure. Additionally, you gain spell sickness eqal to the points of failure.

#### Thornvalder

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a spined spirit of nature to strike a foe within range, treat as a biting attack. If the attack would damage the foe's armor or be a critical hit, you may direct to inflict an attack against another foe within 10 yards. It can be directed again this way, but cannot strike the same creature multiple times. When this inflicts a critical hit against an undead creature, to reduces its points of undeath by an amount equal to the spell's tier squared. If that creature does not have points of undeath, the attack instead gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier. Against non-undead creatures, if the attack is a critical hit, it also inflicts a piercing attack against the creature.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the range is increased by 5 yards (including the range for redirection) and the biting attack gains a +1 bonus for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.

**Critical Failure**: The spirit conjured is quite upset with you. It grapples you for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. You cannot fight against this. During the primary action phase while you are grappled, it inflicts a biting attack against you. During the secondary action phase of each such round, it inflicts a piercing attack. You are prone during this time.

A creature may spend their action attempting to break free from the threads by performing either a [Body] check or [Will] check against a DV equal to the spell check's points of success + spell's tier + caster's [Magic] bonus + caster's [Will] bonus.

A critical success with this spell allows you to bind a number of creatures this way, so long as each additional creature is within a number of feet equal to the points of success from the original target. The duration is divided by the number of creatures bound this way.

This spell is capable of binding ephemera. Undead, Fiends, and Ephemera have disadvantage on checks to break free from this binding.

**At Higher Tiers**: When cast at 5th tier or higher, you may choose one of the following
* The range is increased by 15 yards.
* The duration is increased by 1 minute.

**Range**: 5 yards

**Duration**: A number of rounds equal to the spell's tier squared

**Effect**: You cause some amount of metal whose total volume could fit within a cube whose total weight is X squared (where X is the spells tier -1), to soften. The material can be shaped like dough. It will gradually reharden. Alternatively, if the material to be affected is a creature composed of metal, inflict an undamaging attack against that creature. If successful, it becomes vulnerable for a number of rounds equal to the attack's points of success + spell's tier. If it is a critical hit, it treats its [Body] as being halved during this time and all attacks against it gain advantage during this time.

Metal Armor affected by this becomes like gambeson until it rehardens. It can be warped while soft to inflict damage to the armor. Any damage done this way costs 1d2+1 times as much to repair. Metal weapons affected by this have disadvantage on their attack rolls.

**At Higher Tiers**: These benefits are listed above.

**Critical Failure**: You have managed to afflict yourself with this in some manner. Your [Body], [Rflx], and [Fort] are all halved for a number of minutes equal to the spell's tier. Additionally, you are prone and vulnerable during this time.

#### Torching Fist

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Effect**: You perform an unarmed attack against a foe, which also inflicts a fire attack against the foe. If either would qualify to damage armor, it instead inflicts an additional fire attack. This can occur for both initial attacks from this spell, but not additional fire attacks.

If you have the foe grappled, both initial attacks gain a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit.

**At Higher Tiers**: The benefits are noted above.

**Critical Failure**: Your fist (or other appropriate bodypart) catches on fire. The spell instead inflicts a fire attack against you with a bonus equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit. Residual burning causes you to emit light like a torch for a number of phases equal to the spell's tier.

### U (4

#### Undying Globe

**Minimum Tier**: 4

**Casting Time**: 10 actions

**Effect**: A sphere of necromantic energy expands out 10 yards from yourself. This globe is an incorporeal entity with points of undeah equal to 25 + [Magic] bonus per spell tier. Being incorporeal, others may occupy the same space it does. Any creature† which attempts to enter the space of the globe must succeed a [Will] save with a DV of triple the spell's tier + your [Magic] bonus or fail to do so. Additionally, if such a cretaure attempts to enter the globe, the caster may use their reaction to preven them from doing so.

The globe can be destroyed as though it were a creature of undeath. Non-magical attacks must be made against the outer barrier of the globe itself to be effective. Magical atttacks passing through the barrier from outside are inflicted against the globe instead of their target. Other magical attacks against or through the space of the barrier function normally.

At the end of each round, any creature† within the sphere is subject to a necrotic attack.  
Any creature of undeath cannot recover points of undeath while inside the globe.  
Anytime a creature performs an incapacitation roll while within the globe, the caster may provide a bonus or penalty up to the tier of the spell.

You may concentrate on this spell when you cast it, forfeiting actions to do so. It lasts until your concentration fails, is ended by your own choice, or it is destroyed.

†Excluding constructs, elementals, ephemera, and undead.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the spheres size, allowing it to reach out an additional yard from you.

**Critical Failure**: The sphere forms as normal, but does not move with you. You find it impossible to even attempt to leave. At the end of each phase, it shrinks by 1 foot. Once it finally shrinks to the point that it must collapse in on you, it inflicts a number of necrotic attacks against you equal to the tier of the spell. An immunity to the harm of necrotic damage does not protect you from this, but instead has the attacks made with disadvantage.

#### Unmaking Aura

**Minimum Tier**: 5

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Duration**: As long as you concentrate on the spell, up to 5 rounds

**Effect**: You reach out around you with unnatural power. For the duration of the spell, the aura moves with you at the center of it. At the end of each round, this spell inflicts a crushing attack against 3 creatures- The nearest creature to you in range, the heavist creature in range (other than you), and a creature of your choice within range. It is possible for two or three attacks from this spell to affect a creature.

This spell cannot affect ephemera.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum sees the maximum number of rounds the aura can last increased by 1.

**Critical Failure**: You produce the aura and do not need to concentrate on it for it to remain, although instead of geeting to choose a creature to attack, it will attack you. Additionally, if you are heavier than any other creature in range, that attack is inflicted against you. Furthermore, if no other creature is within range, another attack is inflicted against you. This can harm you even if you would otherwise be immune to crushing attacks.

#### Unnatural Lightning

**Minimum Tier**: 4

**Casting Time**: 1 Action

**Effect**: You direct a stream of energized particles in a 7 yard semifan or mikrofan (your choice when casting). Anything within the area is subject to an electric attack. If an attack from this spell would qualify to damage armor, the foe must instead succeed a [Rflx] save with a DV equal to the caster's [Magic] bonus + double the spell's tier or be prone until the end of the round. A creature that critically fails this is vulnerable during this time.

When you cast this spell, you may use your reaction to grant advantage on a single attack made by the spell.

If the spellcheck was a critical success, the caster may knock back any affected creature a number of feet equal to the spellcheck's points of success divided by the creatre's weight in stones.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to either extend the range of the spell's semifanfan by 1 yard or grant a single attack from the spell a +1 bonus.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to ground the power correctly, inflicting a number of electic attacks against yourself equal to the spell's tier -1.


#### Unrest for Undeath

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 6 actions

**Range**: 3 yards

**Effect**: From you emits a circle of energy which disturbs the very nature of the necromantic bindings of undead creatures, which extends out to the range of the spell. Choose either crushing, psychic, raadiant, or necrotic. An attack of the chosen type is inflicted on all undead creatures within the circle. Additionally, creatures of undeath within the circle lose 1d12+[Magic] bonus points of undeath per tier of the spell.  
Any undead creature first affected by the circle of the spell is subject to an undamaging attack. If it is a critical sucess, the creature is destroyed.

You may concentrate on this spell when you cast it, forfeiting actions, reactions, and movement to do so. If you do, at the end of each action phase, the effects of the ciricle are applied again. Furthermore, you may use your reaction to inflict an additional attack against an undead or ephermal creature of a type not chosen from the options of the circle without breaking your concentration on the spell. Note that a creature is only affected by the undamaging attack the first time the casting of the spell affects it.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 1.5 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The circle is produced, but only inflicts the initial attack. Immediately after, runes and mystical shapes produced by the circle swirl and close in on you, inflicting the same sort of attack against yourself. Any undead or ephemeral creature, must succeed a [Will] save with a DV equal to triple the spell's tier + 4 or treat ou as the target of its hostility for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. Such a creature must attempt to harm you in any way it can, even if it was friendly.

### V (9

#### Vapors

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Effect**: You push out a spray of flammable gas in a 7 yard semifan or mikrofan (your choice). Anything which breathes in the vapours must succeed a [Fort] save or suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls, checks, and saves for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. These vapors will last until the end of the next round, expanding out 1 foot in each direction at the end of each phase.  
Any fire (including ray attacks and other magical projectiles) which comes in contact with the vapor will cause the entire area to combust, neutralizing the vapors and inflicting a non-magical fire attack against everything within.

The save DV is equal to your [Magic] bonus + double the spell's tier. If the spellcheck is a critical success, you may have the vapors begin up to 1 foot away from you.

**At Higher Tiers**: In addition to the above noted benefits, for each tier beyond minimum, you may choose one of the following  
* The length of the area is increased by 1 yard
* The duration of the vapros is increased by 1 round

#### Venting Burst

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Effect**: You produce a line up to 6 yards long and up to 1 yard high and wide. Everything in the way of this line is pushed back a number of feet equal to the spell check result + spell tier + [Magic] score divided by their weight in stones. Alternatively, you may have the shap of the effect by a cone. If so, the range is reduced to a third of its length. Furthermore, you may opt to have the shape changed to a fan or semifan, but this halves the length.

This can blow away gasses and vapors, including those of a magical nature.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the length by 3 yards in addition to the above mentioned benefit. You may instead choose to increase the range of the spell by 3 yards for any tiers above minimum.

**Critical Failure**: You knockback yourself in a random direction as though you were affected by the spell's effect and gain a point of spell sickness.

#### Vile Vibration

**Minimum Tier**: 2

#### Vlepancy

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Duration**: 5 + [Magic] bonus minutes

**Effect**: You touch a reflective surface, granting it the ability to display magical effects which appear as reflections in the surface. If that reflective surface functions as an eye or other sensory item, and the spell check is a critical success, the eye/item can directly see magical effects as well.

**Critical Failure**: You swear you see something, but it vanishes before you can identify it. After a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier, you gain 1d4 spell sickness.

#### Voice of Familiarity

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Effect**: You send a telpathic message to any number of creatures you are personally familiar with on the same plane of existence. The length of the message is a number of words equal to the spell's tier divided by the number of creatures you choose to communicate with. This spell does not allow you to know if a creature received your message or if it is even on the same plane of existence.

When you cast this, you may choose for recipients to understand the message to be of your voice or as an unknown voice.

A critical success with the spell allows you to do one of the following;  
Increase the word count to increase to spell tier + [Magic] bonus divided by number of intended recipients, or  
Treat the "voice" of the spell as being one of another creature you are familiar with.

This is the number of attacks made against each creature within the space. The projectiles each inflict a club or sling attack (your choice). If the spell check was a critical success, you may change the damage type to be force or piercing.

**At Higher Tiers**: As noted above, each tier increases the number of attacks by 1. Additionally, you may increases one dimension or both of the affected area by up to 2 yards for each tier beyond minimum.

If the spell check is a critical success, the attack suffers a penalty equal to the spell's tier for the purpose of determining a critical hit.

You cannot cast this spell as a result of another creature's magical influence over you

**At Higher Tiers**: In addition to the benefits noted above, for each tier beyond minimum, you may choose to increase X in the spell's range by 1 or gain a +1 to your defense against the attack.

#### Waedervalder

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a seafoam tailed spirit of nature to strike a foe within range, treat as a force attack.

As a reaction, it can be directed against another foe, inflicting the force attack. Each round, during the primary action phase, it will attack the creature it ws last directed against. The caster of the spell may use their reaction to assign a new target.

A critical success with the spell check allows the caster to choose the direction a foe is knocked back.

The spirit is capable of moving through liquids unimpeded. The spirit ceases to be after a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier +1.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 2.5 yards.

#### Wall of Denial

**Minimum Tier**: 4

**Casting Time**: 6 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You produce a barrier as thin as 1 inch or as thick as 1 foot which is 40 contiguous square feet. The barrier does not impose itself into or through any object which was already in place when the wall materializes. The barrier exists as long as you concentrate on it and remain within range. A critical success with the spell check lets it last for a number of rounds equal to half of the points of success.

Non-magical projectiles (including any loose object which is thrown or otherwise propelled but not carried by a creature) which are not larger than the surface of the barrier cannot pass through it, nor can the rays of wands and staves. Projectiles and rays from spells whose total tier is less than half of this spell's tier cannot bypass the wall.  Magical items (including magical munitions of a weapon) passing through the barriar have their total movement/range reduced by a number of yards equal to the spell's tier. In the case of those carried by a creature, there is no effect unless it is armor. A creature attempting to pass through the barrier in magical armor has that movement reduced by a number of feet equal to the spell's tier. Note that the given falling speed of a creature is likely to exceed the loss caused by the barrier, making this ineffective to use as a bridge for those donning magic armor.

Something like the Creeping Death spell could move around the barrier if it does not seal of the only passage way. This spell does not prevent creatures from moving within nor the items carried by said creature.

**Effect**:  You create a thin flexible forcefield around a creature you touch which can protect them from harm. The creature's minimum defense against non-melee attacks is equal to 2 + the spell's tier. A critical hit against the subject will dismiss the protection. If the spellcheck is a critical success, the minimum defense is increased by [Magic] bonus.

**At Higher Tiers**: When cast at 3rd tier or higher, the spell gains one of the following advantage for each tier beyond minimum
* The minimum defense is increased by 1.
* The duration is increased by 1 minute.

This spell is active as long as you concentrate on it. When casting or concentrating on this spell, you may spend any additional number of additional actions to increase the volume you can affect by a number of cubic feet equal to the spell's tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the range is increased. It will a number of yards equal to the spell's tier, squared.

**Critical Failure**: The water is manipulated in such a way as to comically spray you, leaving you dazed until the end of the round, before returning to its previous state. If the tier was increased at all, you are also kncked back a number of feet equal to the spell's tier.

#### Wave of Mortality

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 5 Actions

**Effect**: You cause a 3 yard fan of necrotic energy to pulse out. Anything in the area suffers a necrotic attack. After a number of rounds has passed equal to the spell's tier, any afflicted creature is subject to an incapacitation save. A creature with no remaining hitpoints has disadvantage on this save.

Construct, Ephemera, and Undead creatures, creatures of undeath, and those produced by the Animate spell cannot be subject to the disadvantage for not having hitpoints.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond the minimum allows you to pulse the wave 1 yard further or reduce the casting time by 1 action (to a minimum of 2 actions).

**Casting Time**: 1 action or reaction

**Range**: 5 yards

**Critical Failure**: You manage to get halfway to your target, but fail to appear properly and are prone until the end of the round as you lose your bearings. Each tier beyond 1st adds a another round in which you are disoriented, leaving you prone.

#### Wretched Ray

**Minimum Tier**: 2

Upon a critcal success with your spell check or a critical failure on the target's save, you may increase or decrease the creature's inebriation by an amount up to the spell's tier.  
You are considered to be familiar with any creature which bears your mark.

If the initial attack is successful, you inflict an attack of the chosen exotic type.

You may wind the globe as though it were a flail/sling. When used for a melee attack, if you have training with flails, you may benefit from it. If using it as a sling or thrown blade and you have training with the appropriate weapon, you may benefit from that training.

**Effect**: You invoke spirits, or some other entites, which rush around in a circle, semisphere, or sphere (your choice) which extends out 3 yards. Choose an exotic damage type.

Anything entering or exiting the area of the spell is subject to an attack. If the attack die roll is even, it is of the chosen type for the spell. If the attack roll is odd, it is of a nature determined by the narrator as appropriate to the spirit(s) summoned. In place of damaging armor, a creature is prone until the end of the next round.

You may use your reaction to inflict an attack against a creature within the area of the spell. An attack inflicted this way gains a bonus equal to the spell's tier if you are also within the area of the spell.

If you cast the spell at a higher tier but did not expand the spell to its fullest extent, it will do so to reach you.
