### Independent Learning
A character is able to learn features outside of what is granted by their class. They may acquire a number of languages and training in weapons equal to their heroism. They may also gain skills, but each skill learned counts as two items of learning.

Learning spells has no limit.

#### Skill Training
As an item of improvement, a character can gain a permanent +1 bonus to a particular skill they are proficient with. This may occur up to a +5 bonus.

#### Time Required
Any such improvement is recommend to require at least 6 hours of study for 45 days minus your [Inte] score. The narrator may opt to replace [Inte] with another ability score if they deem appropriate. For example, allowing one to use their [Rflx] to practice something like weapon training.
