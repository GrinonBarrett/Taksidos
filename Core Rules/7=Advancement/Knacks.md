Knacks are odd abilities that can picked up through individual learning. Some knacks require multiple items worth of learning to acquire. The name, item cost, and effect of each item is below.

**Incantations**, 1 item  
You memorize an incantation for casting your spells. When you roll your spellcheck, you gain a +1 bonus for each whole round the spellcasting takes. If the spell's casting times is measured in minutes or hours, the bonus is based on that unit of measurement instead. This bonus is not taken into account for determining if the spell check is a critical success.

**Mobile Strikes**, 2 items  
Once per round, when you attack, if you moved the entirety of your movement (either a typical mode of movement or sprint) since the beginning of the round or your previous action- you may use your reaction to grant yourself a +2 bonus to your melee attack or +1 bonus to another attack. If you do, and the attack is a critical failure, you are vulnerable until the end of the round.

**Somatic Components**, 2 items  
You can perform gestures to grant you a bonus to your spell check. You gain a d4+X bonus to your spell check, where X is the spell tier. When wearing Gambeson armor, this is reduced to 1d4. In other armor, you gain only a +1 bonus.  
You cannot use equipment in your hands when casting a spell with somatic components, nor can you benefit from this if you are in anyway bound or restrained.

**Vigilance**, 1 item  
When rolling for initiative, roll an additional d6 and add it to your result. Additionally, so long as another chit has yet to be claimed, another creature cannot assign you a chit normally unless you allow it.
