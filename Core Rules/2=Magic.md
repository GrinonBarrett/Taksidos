Magic occurs in the form of spells. To cast a spell, the character performs a spellcheck. The spell check result must be at least as high as the spell's requirement. The requirement is based on the tier. You roll a d20, add the appropriate casting attibute modifier (if any), and your heroism. If you succeed, you cast the spell. 

Spells have a minimum tier. The spell cannot be cast lower than that tier. The difficulty of casting a spell is 7 + triple spell tier. To make a save against a spell, the DV is double the spell's tier plus the caster's points of success on their spellcheck.

A successful spllcheck imposes a point of spell-sickness, though a critical success does not. Failure Results in no effect and also imposes a point of spell sickness per spell tier. In the event of a critical failure, the spell dictates what can happen, in addition to receiving the spell-sickness for failure.  

Each character is capable of casting spells they know, without any class features, but is not considered to have an associated [Magic] attribute.

A [Magic] attribute is the attribute used by a special form of spellcasting.

A character may only cast a spell if they know the spell.
