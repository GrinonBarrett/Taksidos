### Determining Class
Each player chooses a character class when making their character. This provides the character with several advantages as they grow including the possibility of a class skill. If a class offers a class skill from a list, you must select one such option if able. If you are already proficient in the listed skills, you may instead choose any skill of your liking.

Once a class is chosen, it cannot be changed.
