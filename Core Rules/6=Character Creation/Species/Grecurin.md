### Special Features

**Marine Breathing**: Grecurin are equally capable of breathing normal air and breathing in untainted bodies of water.

**Single Claw**: Grecurin have a single claw which may be used as their main hand. They have no other manipulators.

**Rough Hide**: A grecurin cannot use armor unless it states otherwise. When unarmored, a grecurin is treated as wearing gambeson.

**Psychic Vulnerability**: Anytime a psychic attack is successful against the grecurin, it is dazed for a number of rounds equal to the points of success.

**Tail Sweep**: Once per round, when your unarmed attack would be a critical hit or you slam a brawling opponent, you may use your reaction to do one of the following;

* You may have that creature perform a [Body] save with a DV equal to your [Body] score plus your level. On a failure, that creature is knocked prone until the end of the round. On a critical failure, it is also vulnerable during this time.  
If it has a greater [Rflx] score than you, it gains advantage on the save.

* Inflict a Club attack against that creature.

**Mild Telepathy**: A grecurin can convey a single sentence of information during each phase. This has a range of 5 yards. If communicating with another grecurin, the range is increased by a number of feet equal to the lowest of either’s [Inte].

**Passive Sense**: Anytime the grecurin would perform a [Prcp] check/save pertaining to detecting a non-mindless creature, it may choose to use its [Inte] attribute.  
Anytime the grecurin would roll for initiative at the start of an encounter, it gains a bonus equal to the number on non-mindless creatures within 15 yards which also rolled for initiative.

**Psychic Wave**: Grecurins are capable of producing a cone of psychic energy, up to 4 yards, as an action. Anything caught within the cone suffers a Psychic attack. If the Grecurin has a higher [Will] than a creature caught in the cone, the attack against that creature gets a +1 bonus. Once the grecurin has used this ability, it cannot do so again until it completes a full rest.
