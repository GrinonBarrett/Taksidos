## Ngurm
Written Qurm in the Lithenic tongue. Scarecrows which have vigilantly looked over a field until the settlers of the field, and their descendants, have passed. These characters often stumble through life mindlessly wandering until they find a purpose or are destroyed. It is said that if they do not find a purpose, one can become a kunekunar, but an over abundance of magical energy can do this as well. Ngurm characters get the following features;

**Creature Type**: Ngurms are Monsters.

**Size**: They stand between 5'9-67'. They can weigh between 40-75 pounds. They are medium creatures.

**Ability Score Modification**: As a ngurm, you have the following changes to your ability scores    
-1 [Empy]  
-2 [Body]  
-4 [Inte]  
+1 [Will]  
+1 [Fort]  
Choose two attributes. They are increased by a single level each.

**Run Speed**: You may run up to 5 yards per move.

**Climb Speed**: You may climb up to 2 yards per move, presuming it is reasonable terrain to climb.

**Swim speed**: You may swim up to 2 feet per move, presuming the water isn’t too rough.

**Languages**: You gain competency in the Common Tongue, the Wild Tongue, and one other language of your choice.

### Special Features

**Strawman Nature**: Ngurms are made of unusual materials. As such they  
 • Do not need to eat or breathe. You still need to sleep.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons, and venom.  
 • You cannot receive wounds as a result of psychic attacks.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh.  
 • When not wearing armor, you are treated as wearing Gambeson, but have a -1 to defense against all attacks. When wearing armor, use the appropriate defense for that armor. So long as it weighs no more than half again, and no less than standard, weight for armor of a creature of your size- you can wear that armor even if it would not be suitable for your creature type.  
 • Cold and toxic attacks have disadvantage against the ngurm. Fire and electric attacks gain advantage against the ngurm.  
 • Critical hits of Fire attacks leave the ngurm vulnerable until the end of the round.  
 • Any effect which would heal the ngurm has a 1 in 3 chance not to.

**Ngurm Resilience**: While wounds are inflicted against a ngurm, they have no ill effect.

**Ngurm Burden**: A ngurm's weight load limits are halved. So long as you are benefitting from it, the weight of armor has no burden against you.

**Bird Scarer**: Anytime you attempt a check relating to intimidating an Avian creature, you may roll an additional d6 and add it to your total. As an action, you may attempt to scare any Avian which can perceive you and you can perceive. The creature must succeed a [Will] or [Prcp] save with a DV equal to your highest attribute score + Heroism or attempt to flee from you for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. A critical failure will startle such a creature that it is prone and vulnerable during this time. A critical success makes the creature immune to all future such attempts by you to scare it.  
You can communicate with avian creatures, even if only primitively, even if you do not share a language.

**Easy Mind**: As a reaction, you may choose to become mindless for 1d10+2 rounds. You cannot be a spiently conscious creature as a result. 

**Ngurm Fate**: Anytime you rest, roll a [Will] or [Fort] save with a DV equal to your spell sickness + the number of wounds you have. If you fail, you cease to be and a kunekunar is created.

**Latent Stop**: You gain a 1d4 bonus to all counter spell checks. At 4th level this becomes a d6. At 8th level this becomes a d8.
