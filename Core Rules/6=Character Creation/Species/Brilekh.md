### Special Features

**Unusual Frame**: Brilekh can use most equipment just fine, but armor must be made especially for them. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for a brilekh cost half again as it would typically.

**Four-Armed**: You have four arms, two on the left and two on the right. 3 of them are off hands. You cannot gain any benefit from using more hands than a manfolk would (for example being able to use more than two hands on a sword) unless otherwise noted. This can allow you to wield two two-handed weapons. When doing so, a weapon wielded with your main hand is treated as a main hand. A weapon wielded only by off hands is treated as being wielded in an off-hand.

**Flex**: You gain a +1 bonus to Athletics and Wrestling checks/saves for each free hand you have.
