### Special Features

**Limited Education**: You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice.

**Long Form**: Centaurs can use most equipment just fine, but armor must be made especially for them. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for a centaur cost twice as much and weighs half again as it would typically. 

**Carrying Capacity**: A centuar's weight load limits are twice that of a normal character.

**Gallop**: If you sprinted twice this round, you may use your reaction to perform a move.

**Limited Trample**: A centaur can trample as though it were a mount, in place of brawling, if it makes contact as a result of sprinting or its gallop ability. Additionally, if it slams a foe, it inflicts a bare attack against that foe.  

**Non-cavalier**: A centaur cannot ride a mount of the same size and must ride a mount of one size category larger than itself. This requires a custom saddle be made for use.
