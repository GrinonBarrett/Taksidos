### Special Features

**Pixall Knowledge**: Choose either Athletics, Spellcraft, or Wrestling. You gain proficiency with it and another skill of your choice.

**Unusual Form**: Any armor crafted for a Pixall would have to be made by a fine jeweler and expert of the craft of armory. This causes the comission of any armor to cost 1d4+3 times the normal cost despite only requiring a tenth of the material (and thus weighing a tenth as much). The repair cost of the armor is not increased per the armor cost, but is instead a flat **seven times the normal cost**.

**Nimble Flight**: So long as you are airborne, not prone or vulnerable, and aware of an attack being made against you- you may roll a d4 and add it to your defense against that attack. This bonus cannot exceed your total movement in yards since the previous action phase. If you are unarmored, this is increased to a d8.

**Bewildery**: When a creature you can perceive would perform a check, save, or attack roll; if it is a critical success or critical failure, you may use your reaction *to inflict or remove 1d4-1 points of inebriation, you choose before rolling*. You cannot affect another fey with this ability.
