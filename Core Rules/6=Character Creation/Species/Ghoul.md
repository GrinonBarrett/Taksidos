### Special Features

**Dead-like**: Anytime an effect would affect an undead creature, it might include yourself. Magical effects may target and/or affect you as though your were undead. If an effect inflicts and attack or save against you but does not also affect monsters, the attack value or dave DV is treated as half.  
You do not need to breathe.  
Any effect which would heal wounds to you has a 50% chance of not affecting you unless it specifically affects undead.  
You cannot be instantly killed by magic unless it specifies otherwise. A wound you receive from Necrotic sources cannot kill you, even if you fail your incapacitation save.

**Necrophage**: You cannot consume traditional food, but must instead subsist on the flesh of dead creatures. Freshly felled creatures can count, as can rotting flesh- so long as the creature was dead. Living flesh provides one-sixth of what it would by weight.  Elemental, Eldritch, Ephemera, Infigura, and Plant creatures do not count towards this. Flesh which was reanimated at any point to be an undead creature (or part of one) does nothing to sate your hunger, which you will realize immediately after consuming.  
Furthermore, your hunger is two and a half times that of a normal player-character's.  
You do not thirst.

**Immunity**: You are not affected by disease, poison, or venom. Effects which deal toxic damage do not affect you.

**Light-Sensitivities**: You treat bright and fair light as darkness, darkness as dim light, and dim light as fair light.  
All radiant attacks have advantage against you. Radiant critical hits, in addition to their standard effect, also can ignite you with a burning glow. You will put off light like a torch until the end of the round and are set ablze, as though by a critical hit from a fiery source.

**Unnatural Creeping**: When you are prone, you do not suffer the usual penalty to movement.

**Scramble**: Once per encounter, when the function of your reaction (such as a feint or parry) would allow you to perform an attack, you may choose instead to move.

**Ghoulish Grasp**: Your unarmed attacks gain a 1d4+1 bonus and can be treated as magical. You also gain a 1d4+1 bonus to checks related to maintaing your grapple against a foe.
