## YNTHVIUR
A sentient ooze that just so happens to exist. No one knows how they come to be, but they seem to spawn in some way. Ynthviur characters get the following features;

**Creature Type**: Ynthviur are infigura.

**Size**: Ynthviur can stretch up to 2 yards or compact down to 1 foot. They are between 44-73 kilos. They can be treated as small or medium creatures.

**Ability Score Modification**: As an Ynthviur, you have the following adjustments to your attributes  
-1 [Body]  
-1 [Fort]  
-1 [Inte]  
-1 [Prcp]  
-2 [Empy]  
Choose an attribute. It is increased by 1.

**Languages**: You gain competency in the Common Tongue and one other language of your choice. You can't speak, but you can understand them just fine.

**Run Speed**: You may run up to 3 yards per move.

**Climb Speed**: You may climb up to 2.5 yards per move, presuming it is reasonable terrain to climb.

**Swim speed**: You may swim up to 1 yards per move, presuming the water isn’t too rough.

### Special Features

**Some Education**: You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

**Amorphous**: Ynthviur don’t retain a single cohesive shape but are instead in the form of a glob of gooey material. This confers some strange properties to it.  
 • Immunity to falling and knockback damage.  
 • Obstacles that would reduce the speed of the ynthviur have only half of their normal effect unless they specifically affect amorphous creatures as well.  
 • All forms of non-magical attack against the ynthviur have disadvantage.  
 • Anytime a spell would be cast against the ynthviur that would affect its form, shape, composition, or mental state- the ynthviur gains a bonus to its saves against that effect equal to its level.  
 • The ynthviur cannot be grappled.  
 • While the ynthviur has a creature grappled, it can treat that creature as being unarmored for the purpose of attacking it.  
 • The ynthviur is capable of traveling through any opening small enough to stick one’s fist.  
 • Cannot use armor, shields, or any item unless it mentions it can be used by the ynthviur. When attacked, treat as wearing gambeson.  
 • Receives wounds, but no effect from them.

 **Infigural Nature**: Being infigura, ynthviur have several advantages.  
 • Immunity to all poisons and diseases, including toxic damage, except those that specifically affect infigura.  
 • Immunity to the effects of bloodloss.  
 • Immunity to fatigue from outside sources. A ynthviur still suffers from fatigue brought on as a result of sorcery.  
 • Immunity to sleep.  
 • Immunity to effects which cause asphyxiation.  
 • Immunity to effects which would inflict the prone condition, unless it specifically targets infigura.  
 • Does not require sleep to rest, but must still manage to relax and unwind as other creatures would.  
 • Immunity to incapacitation, but is destroyed when wounded with no remaining hitpoints.

**Minimal Sensing**: The ynthviur is, in the most technical sense, blind. It is also devoid of the senses of smell and hearing. Instead it relies on sensing vibrations and its ability to taste everything it comes in contact with. Anytime it would attempt a check or save based on perceiving something, it has disadvantage (likewise, it should get advantage against illusions based on such stimuli). If it would rely on multiple missing senses, it suffers an additional -2 penalty for each total sense. If it is touching or tasting something, it does not have any issues identifying it.

**Stretchy**: Because it can change its size, the ynthviur may choose to switch between being medium or small as an action or reaction.

**Potentially Venomous Gel**: The ynthviur may treat critical hits of its unarmed attacks as being toxic attacks.

**Weak**: Your weight capacity is reduced to ½ at all load levels.

**Surprisingly Flexible**: Anytime you perform an athletics check, you may replace one of the dice with a d12.

**Ynthviurian Psyche**: The ynthviur is a sentient and psychically powerful infigura. All Psychic attacks against an Ynthviur have disadvantage. Additionally, the Ynthviur has 10 pysche points it may spend to use its Psyche features. it recovers 1 such point on a short rest, 1d4+3 on a long rest, and all expent points on a full rest.

#### Psyche Features

**Boost**: Anytime you perform a [Will] or [Inte] save, you may spend any number of psyche points to roll an equal number of d4s and add the results to your save.

**Psychic Feel**: When you roll for initiative, you may choose to spend a psyche point to gain an amount of initiative equal to the total number of non-mindless creatures which rolled for initiative for the encounter. You also know the exact location of each non-mindless creature which rolled initiative until the end of the first round.

**Psychic Scream**: As an action or reaction you loose a powerful wave of psychic energy which bleeds into the mind as a shrill scream. You may expend 3 psyche points to force every creature within a number of feet equal to your [Will] score + your level which is not mindless, or is mindless but connected to the psychic plane, to be subject to a pschic attack. Other ynthviur gain a +4 to their defense against this scream.

**Psychogrip**: As an action or reaction when grappling a foe, you may inflict a melee psychic attack against that creature by expending at least 3 psyche points. If you do, you may treat its critical hit effect as being that of a toxic attack. Every additional psyche point spent beyond the 3 grant a +1 for the purposes of determining if it is a critical hit.

**Vision**: You may expend 2 psyche points to grant yourself a sort of vision. You cannot distinguish between colors or lighting this way (treat everything as dim light) and this vision extends out as a sphere from your body rather than a directed gaze. This lasts for up to an hour.

**Words of the Mind**: You are able to project a sort of imaginary voice which can be understood by non-mindless creatures. No actual sound is made and a creature is not so intruded upon that they could not simply ignore. You may spend 1 psyche point to produce this voice which is capable of being received by any creature within a number of yards equal to your [Inte] score. This lasts for 15 minutes and is not technically a magical effect.
