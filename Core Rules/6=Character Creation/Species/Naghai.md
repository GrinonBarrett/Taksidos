### Special Features

**Long Form**: Naghai can use most equipment just fine, but armor must be made especially for them. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for a naghai cost twice as much and weighs half again as it would typically. 

**Serpentine Figure**: You gain proficiency in either the Athletics or Wrestling skill. Once chosen, this cannot be changed. You gain a bonus to initiative equal to your [Rflx] bonus.

**Slippery**: Once per encounter, when rolling an opposed check in a brawl or an opposed [Rflx] roll while being trampled, you may gain a bonus equal to half of your level. This is done after you roll the die, but before it is revealed if it is a success or failure.

**Tail Slap**: As a reaction, you may use your tail to inflict a club attack against a creature within 2 feet in any direction. Additionally, anytime you perform an attack with your tail as a result of your reaction, you may treat it as a club or bare attack.

**Tail Sweep**: Once per round, when your unarmed attack would be a critical hit or you slam a brawling opponent, you may use your reaction to do one of the following;

* You may have that creature perform a [Body] save with a DV equal to your [Body] score plus your level. On a failure, that creature is knocked prone until the end of the round. On a critical failure, it is also vulnerable during this time.  
If it has a greater [Rflx] score than you, it gains advantage on the save.

* Inflict a Club attack against that creature.
