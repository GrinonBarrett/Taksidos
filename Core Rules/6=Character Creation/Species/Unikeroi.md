**Unikeroi Porificiency**: You gain proficiency in two Zoology skills of your choice. You also gain proficiency in Animal Empathy.

**Equine Form**: Armor must be made especially for an unikeroi. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for an unikeroi costs thrice as much and weighs double what it would typically. 

**Hooves**: Unikeroi cannot use most equipment unless it specifies it can be used by an Unikerai. The Unikerai tramples, as though it were a mount, in place of brawling.

**Carrying Capacity**: An unikeroi's weight load capacity is thrice that of a normal character.

**Impalement**: Anytime you would perform an attack of opportunity with an unarmed attack or you would perform a counter attack, you may have it treated as a Piercing attack so long as you are not prone or restrained.

**Unikeroi Magic**: An unikerai has innate magical abilities. It has a pool magic points, whose maximum is equal to its level. A long rest recovers a single point. A full rest recovers 2 points. The following features are available and each considered magical effects.

• **Curative Whisper**. Costs 3 points.  
The unikerai recites an inaudible magic word to another creature within 3 yards as a special action. Roll a d4. If the result is greater than that creature’s missing hitpoints, that creature has a single hitpoint restored. 

• **Glow**. Costs 1 point.  
The unikerai’s horn emits light like a torch. This will last for up to a number of minutes equal to the unikeroi’s [Will]. The unikeroi may use this ability again while it is active to extend the duration appropriately. It may choose to end this ability at will.  

• **Spark of Light**. 3 points.  
The unikerai hurls a beam or shape of light from its horn towards the target. This functions as a wand attack using the unikerai’s [Will]. It is a radiant attack.
