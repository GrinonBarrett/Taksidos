### Special Features

**Great Education**: You gain proficiency in three skills of your choice.

**Limbless Form**: Tragoi do not have arms, legs, or other appendages. They may only hold something with their mouth, allowing it to function as a hand.

**Eye Stalks**: Tragoi can rotate their vision. This occurs when rotations would during the round. The helicidai can rotate their vision during the same or different phases that they rotate their body. Their eye stalks may each only rotate up to 90 degrees left or right per phase.

**Acidic Body**: The acidic body of the tragai provides the following;  
 • You cannot wear or benefit from armor.  
 • Anytime a creature performs an unarmed attack against you, it suffers an acid attack with disadvantage.  
 • At the end of any round you are grappling another creature, you inflict an acid attack against them with disadvantage. You may use your reaction to have that attack made without disadvantage.  
 • If you are trampled by a creature, it suffers an acid attack with disadvantage.

**Drop Resistance**: When inflicting attacks against the tragai for falling, halve the total umber of attacks beyon the first three.

**Mucous**: The body of a helicdai is coated in a  mucous which is constantly being produced. This confers several advantages  
 • Anytime you would need to make a [Fort] or [Rflx] save as a result of a fluid you are submerged in, you gain an advantage on that save.  
 • You may spend a minute coating specific points of a surface in your mucous manually to grant yourself a +2 bonus to checks/saves pertaining to climbing or retaining your balance on that surface. Any creature which does not have the Mucous feature which crosses the path has a -2 penalty to such checks/saves unless they allow the mucous to dissipate which does so after a minute in normal air or water.  
 • While you are unarmored, your defense against all attacks is increased by 1. Against unarmed attacks, it is instead increased by 2.

**Breath Weapon**: Tragoi are capable of exhaling a line of acid, as an action. The line is a number of yards in length equal to your level and is half a foot high and wide. Anything caught within the line suffers an Acid attack. Once the tragai has used this ability, it cannot do so again for 1d6 hours.  
Alternatively, you may cause the breath weapon to take the form of a cone. Doing so reduces the length to one third of its usual length as you sweep your head side to side.

**Tail Slap**: As a reaction, you may use your tail to inflict a club attack against a creature within 2 feet in any direction. Additionally, anytime you perform an attack as a result of your reaction, you may treat it as a club or unarmed attack using your tail.
