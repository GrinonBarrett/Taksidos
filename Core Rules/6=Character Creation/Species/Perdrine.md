## PERDRINE
A floating head animated by magic, perdrines are typically the result of some dark magic. Some are created as a result of a necromancer’s indenturing rituals, others elect to allow a powerful entity to transform them that they may serve some purpose long after their natural expiration.  Many which are made in service of a necromancer are skeletal, becoming a sort of faceless servant- but many often retain the visage of their face in life. Perdrine characters get the following features;

**Creature Type**: Perdrines are undead.

### Special Features

**Skillful**: You gain proficiency in four skills of your choice. Choose one of those skills, you gain a +1 bonus to all checks involving that skill. In place of choosing one or two of those skills, training in weapons may be taken.

**Innate Magical Power**: You learn a spell of your choice with a minimum tier of exactly 1. Additionally, you have a pool of 2 points of energy which may be used to grant a +1d2 bonus to a spell check or counter-spell check. You recover 1 such point on a long rest and all consumed points with a full rest.
At 7th level, this pool is increased by 1.

**Undead Nature**: Perdrine are reanimated dead, which grants them a few advantages.  
 • Perdrine do not need to eat, sleep or breath. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • You are not affected by disease, poison, or venom. Effects which deal toxic damage do not affect you.  
 • You are immune to bloodloss.  
 • All forms of healing which would affect you have a 2 in 3 chance not to.  
 • You do not suffer effects of wounds. You do still receive wounds as a normal character though.

**Limited Form**: Perdrine have no limbs. They may only hold something with their mouth, allowing it to function as a hand without fine motor skills.  
Additionally, they cannot use any form of gear (including armor and weapons) which would require fine manipulation. Attack rolls made with weapons are made with disadvantage.

**Weak**: Your weight capacity is reduced by ½ at all load levels.

**Immunities**: The unique nature of a perdrine grants them several immunities as follows-  
 • Magic which affects flesh cannot affect you in any way.  
 • You are also immune to damage and other effects from unarmed attacks.  
 • Unarmed and weapon attacks against you cannot be a critical hit.

**Difficult to Hit**: Your defense is equal to your Heroism + your [Body] bonus + your [Rflx] bonus.

**Voidtouched**: You have seen the veil and, as a result, find yourself numb to the fears of mortality. Unless specified otherwise, fear based effects cannot affect you.

**Already Dead**: You cannot be instantly killed by magic unless it specifies otherwise. A wound you receive from Necrotic sources cannot kill you, even if you fail your incapacitation save.

**Locate Dead**: You may, at will, choose to know the precise location of every dead creature within a number of yards equal to triple your level. You can detect a dead creature so long as it would have some recognizable remains within range (even if you cannot normally perceive them). When you do so, you also know whether or not there is any undead creatures (other than yourself) within range (but not their exact location, number, or nature). You must rest before doing so again.

**Perdrine Power**: Every perdrine’s creation bestows it with one of a number of powers. Select one of the Perdrine Powers listed at the end of this block. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed.

#### PERDRINE POWERS
Below is each perdrine power. Note that many powers manifest in different ways.

**Ungrateful Dead**: You have such resentment for your state that it has actually affected the nature of the magic animating you.    
 • Anytime an undead creature attacks you, you may roll a d8 and add it your defense.  
 • When you use your Locate Dead feature, you can tell if there is a single undead creature or multiple.  
 • You may use your Locate Dead feature twice between rests.  
 • When an attack against you is a critical failure, you may move up to 1 yard.

**Bone Head**: Not everyone develops flashy powers. Sometimes, you are just difficult instead.  
 • You ignore damage from falling and knockback.  
 • Anytime you are attacked and aware of the attack, so long as you are not dazed or prone, you may roll a d3 and apply the result to your defense against that attack.  
 • All forms of psychic attack against you have disadvantage.  
 • You speed is increased by .5 yard in all modes.

**Wise Guy**: You have gained much knowledge as a result of your time in this state.  
 • Your individual learning is increased by a number of items equal to your heroism.  
 • At 3rd, 7th, and 10th level, you gain an additional skill proficiency or weapon training choice.

**Sentry**: You have been, or are currently, pressed for service by guarding something.  
 • You have a sense which reaches out 2 yards from you that allows you to function as though you could see perfectly. You do not actually see this way, but instead can sense distance from objects almost like a form of supernatural radar.  
 • Anytime you roll for initiative, you gain a bonus equal to your level.  
 • Your maximum hitpoints are increased by 1.

**Burning Fury**: Whether you are a flaming skull, or simply a head wreathed in brilliance, you have been kissed by flame.  
 • Anytime a creature within 1 yard attacks you and either hits or critically fails their attack, you may use your reaction to *inflict a fire attack against that foe*.  
 • You may choose, as a special ability or attack action, to emit bright light out to 3 yards and may choose to emit dim light up to 3 yards beyond that. Alternatively, you may have any bright light you would emit instead be fair or dim. Changing the radius or turning of the ability on/off is an action.  
 • When you would be destroyed, you may choose to explode. Anything within a number of half yards equal to your level are subject to a fire attack. A creature gains a +1 bonus to their defense for each yard away from the explosion.

**Great Mind**: You had, or have since developed, some psionic abilities.  
 • You are capable of acting with telekinetics as though you had two arms with fingers and fine motor skills to perform a single task. You may do this out to a number of feet equal to your level + your heroism. You must perform a rest before doing so again.  
 • *You may throw a creature or object within 15 yards as an action. It is moved a number of yards equal to your [Inte], multiplied by your level, divided by half its weight in stoness*. You must complete a full rest to do so again.  
 • You may secretly perform an opposed [Will] check against a creature within 1 yard as a special action. If you succeed, you know if the creature is engaging in telepathic communication and with what creature/object it is communicating with if it is within a number of yards to you equal your level. If it is a critical success, you receive the telepathic communications to and from that targeted creature. If it is a critical failure, that creature and anything it is telepathically communicating with (if anything) is aware of your attempt to pry- regardless of whether it was engaged in telepathy or not.
