### Special Features

**Marine Breathing**: Anuroi are equally capable of breathing normal air and breathing in untainted bodies of water.

**Great Leap**: Once per encounter, as an action, you may perform a great leap. Treat as a jump whose maximum distance is increased by a number of yards up to your [Body] bonus.

**Fine Flip**: In place of performing an attack (by action or reaction), you may perform a fine flip. Treat as a jump whose maximum distance is increased by a number of feet equal to your [Body] score. For the purpose of falling as a result, you ignore a number of feet equal to your [Body] score. You must perform a rest before doing so again.

**Mucous**: The body of an anurai is coated in a mucous which is constantly being produced. This confers several advantages  
 • Anytime you would need to make a [Fort] or [Rflx] save as a result of a fluid you are submerged in, you gain advantage on that save.  
 • You may spend a minute coating specific points of a surface in your mucous manually to grant yourself a +2 bonus to checks/saves pertaining to climbing or retaining your balance on that surface. Any creature which does not have the Mucous feature which crosses the path has a -2 penalty to such checks/saves unless they allow the mucous to dissipate which does so after a minute in normal air or water.  
• While you are unarmored, your defense against all attacks is increased by 1. Against unarmed attacks, it is instead increased by half of your current level.
