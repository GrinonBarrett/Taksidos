### Special Features

**Elemental Nature**: Magmen are animated manifestations of wild, natural, forms of energy. As such they;  
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh.  

**Body of Lava**: Magmen, having a body composed of molten rock, have a few quirks.  
 • Cannot be affected by fire in any manner.  
 • Cannot wear armor. They are treated as wearing brigandine.  
 • They do not receive damage from being crushed (including crushing attacks), falling, or knockback- but instead become dazed and prone for a number of rounds equal to the attack(s) total.  
 • Cold attacks against the magman have disadvantage and cause the magman to be prone for a number of rounds equal to the attack total. This is cumulative.  
 • Critical hits of Cold and Crushing attacks leave the magman vulnerable until the end of the round, even if the magman would not be wounded by it.  
 • Every round the magman spends at least half submerged in water reduces its run and climb speeds by 1 foot until it spend twice as much time dry. This is cumulative. Once the magman's last mode of movement is reduced to 0 this way, it loses the ability to move at all until the appropriate amount of time has been spent dry.  
 • The magman may put off light like a torch. This feature is an action to activate or deactivate.  
 • Any effect which would heal the magman has a 1 in 3 chance not to.  
 • They do not swim in water, instead walking on the surface below.

**Molten Guard**: The unusual surface of the magman’s form causes all successful unarmed attacks against the magman to potentially burn that foe, inflicting a fire attack.
