### Special Features

**Sylphen Knowledge**: You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

**Unusual Form**: Unless otherwise noted, sylphes cannot use equipment or armor. 

**Nimble Flight**: So long as you are airborne, not prone, and aware of an attack being made against you- you may roll a d6 and add it to your defense against that attack. This bonus cannot exceed your total movement in yards.

**Breezeless**: A sylphe may choose to ignore the effects of the wind. Magical effects still function against the sylphe.

**Raging Gust**: Once per encounter as an action, _you can cause a powerful burst of wind to manifest. This is a line up to a number of yards in length equal to your level + 5. Its width and height is at least 1 yard but can be up to half of its length. Anything in the space must succeed a [Body] save with a DV equal to your level + your heroism or be knocked back back a number of feet equal to the points of failure. A critical failure results in the creature being prone until the end of the next round_.

**Sylphe’s Field**: Once per encounter as an action, you may produce a field around yourself which strecthes up to a number of feet equal to your level. _Projectiles, particulates (such as dirt and sand) and minor objects (such as papers, marbles, random knick knacks of an unsecured variety, loose clothing, etc) cannot move into or out of the field. The field, and anything within it, are suspended in the space occupied by the field. This stops any falling or knockback that would occur when the field is active. The field remains active for up to 3 rounds._
