### Special Features

**Some Education**: You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

**Meagre Apetite**: You require half as much food and water as a normal adventurer.

**No Hands**: Unless otherwise noted, iptemeneoi cannot use equipment.

**Odd Form**: Armor must be made especially for an iptemenai. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for an iptemenai weighs half as much. The cost of the armor, despite requiring less material, is the same as armor for a standard form.  

**Physical Alacrity**: Once per encounter, you may grant yourself a bonus to an Athletics check or save equal to your level.

**Stinger**: As an additional option when you achieve a critical success while brawling, you may strike the foe with your stinger. This is a piercing attack. You may also perform such an attack against a foe within 1 foot as a reaction.

**Venom**: When you successfully attack with your stinger, you may choose to inject venom into the struck creature. If you do, it must succeed a [Fort] save or lose 1 hitpoint. At the end of each round, for a number of rounds equal to your level, a new save must be made or the creature will lose another hitpoint. Once the venom has been injected, you cannot produce enough to do so again until you complete a long or full rest.  
THe DV of the save is equal to double your level.  
You are immune to the venom of another iptemenoi.
