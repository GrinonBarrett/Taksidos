### Special Features

**Carapace**: A garguilar cannot use armor unless it states otherwise. When unarmored, the garguilar is treated as wearing cuirass. Often times, the silhouette of the carapace may match armor they wore in their previous life.

**Glider**: A garguilar which is not prone or immobile can choose to reduce its fall speed by half. If it does, it may move partal as it falls in a direction of its choice (such as forwed, backward, or to the sides but not up) as it glides with the use of its wings. Additionally, if it falls, due to this reduced speed, it treats the fall as being half of the traveled distance and can use its reaction to make an Athletics check using [Rflx] or [Body] (its choice) with a DV equal to effective distance fallen. If it is not vulnerable or dazed, it may also choose to gain a bonus to this check equal to its heroism. A critical failure will cause it to be prone for a number of rounds equal to the points if failure. A critical success regains the use of their reaction.  
If it would be knocked by by the effect of wind (of a magical nature or otherwise), it may choose to increase the knockback it receives by half.

**Low Light Vision**: Within 5 yards, the garguilar may treat dim light as though it were fair light.

**Fleet Foot**: A garguilar adds their heroism to their initiatuve rolls.

**Winged Lunge**: As an action or reaction, a garguilar may push itself away from a surface or object capable of bearing its weight and perform a small burst of flight. It is treated as performing a jump, with the maximum height and distance doubled. This movement counts towards remaining airborne.

**Vicious Bite**: As an additional option when you succeed a critical success while brawling, you may bite the foe whom you are brawling. This is treated as a Biting attack (ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling).

**Discomfort in Light**: While in sunlight, the garguilar is treated as having a heroism of 0. Additionally, when the garguilar enters bright light it becomes either dazed or vulnerable (its choice) until it exits such light.
