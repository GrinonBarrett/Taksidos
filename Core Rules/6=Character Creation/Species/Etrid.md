### Special Features

**Battle Ready**: You gain training in a weapon of your choice.

**Rough Hide**: Etrids cannot use armor unless it states otherwise. When unarmored, an etrid is treated as wearing Gambeson.

**Stiff Joints**: Any sprint action you take requires you take a level of fatigue.

**Primal Instincts**: As an action, you may enter a frenzied state. While in this state;  
 • You gain a +3 bonus to [Body] checks and saves, +2 to [Will] checks and saves, and +1 bonus to [Rflx] checks and saves.  
 • Your rough hide provides defense like Brigindine.  
 • Anytime you perform an [Inte] check or save, roll a d8. This is a penalty suffered to the check/save.  
 • You ignore your Stiff Joints feature.  
This frenzy lasts for 2d6+3 rounds.  
Once the frenzy ends, you suffer two levels of exhaustion.

**Venomous Bite**: As an additional option when you succeed a critical success while brawling, you may bite the foe whom you are brawling. This is treated as a biting attack (ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling). If it hits, the victim must succeed a [Fort] save with a DV equal to 10 + your level or lose 1 hitpoint as a result of the venom. An additional save must be made at the end of every round until two successful saves are made. Each failure has the venom reduce its hitpoints by 1.  
An etrid gains a +5 bonus to their saves against an etrid’s bite.
