### Special Features

**Marine Breathing**:  Oddu are equally capable of breathing normal air and breathing in untainted bodies of water.

**Unusual Frame**: Oddu can use most equipment just fine, but armor must be made especially for them. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for an oddu cost double what it would typically and weighs half as much.

**Eight Tentacles**: You have eight tentacles which you can use as arms. All of them are off hands. You cannot gain any benefit from using more hands than a manfolk would (for example being able to use more than two hands on a sword) unless otherwise noted. This can allow you to wield up to four two-handed weapons. You only have the coordination to use as many tenactles as your current [Rflx] score. Certain tasks which might require fine manipulation, such as trying to pick a lock, are done with disadvantage.

**Flex**: You gain a +1 bonus to Athletics and Wrestling checks/saves for each free "hand" you have.

**Octostride**: Your Run and Climb speeds are increased by half a foot for each free tentacle you have beyond 2.
