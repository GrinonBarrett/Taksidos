### Arcane Proficiency
You gain a level of training with wands and staves. You also learn a spell as determined by the narrator. When a spell references your [Magic] score/bonus, you may use your [Inte] score/bonus.

### Arcane Study
You are able to perform intense calculations about the nature of magic. When you perform a spellcheck or a skill check involving the nature of magic you may spend an additional round without performing any actions to gain a bonus equal to your [Inte] bonus.  
Additionally, when you perform a spellcheck, you may choose to roll 2d8 instead of 1d20. If you do, you gain a bonus equal to your [Inte] bonus.  
Furthermore, when performing a counter-spell check, you may add your [Inte] bonus.

### 2) Arcanae
You can commit arcane formulas to memory, allowing you to easily cast spells at a later time without enduring the effects of spell sickness. This requires time and puts strain on the arcanist's mind. The time required is a number of minutes equal to 15 minutes plus 12 minutes per spell tier. Additionally, your [Inte] is temporarily reduced as a result of the strain on your mind. This reduction is 1 + double the tier of the spell. When the spell is cast, you do not roll 1d20 for the spellcheck but instead use your [Inte] score at the time the spell was memorized. Once the spell is cast, it no longer burdens the arcanist's mind.  
You may choose to let a memorized arcana go, loosing it from your mind and freeing it of the burden, but suffer Spell Sickness equal to the spell's tier if you do.

### 2) Magic Press
The bonus to spell checks you gain from staves for spells you know is increased by 1.
When you perform an attack with a wand, staff, or spell, you may use your reaction to gain a +1 bonus to that attack.

### 3) Phased Strike
When you attack a creature afflicted with more Spell Sickness than yourself, including an attack from a spell, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack roll.

### 4) Disruptive Strike
When you successfully perform a melee attack against a creature which is casting a spell or afflicted by Spell Sickness, it incurs a point of Spell Sickness.

### 4) Spell Leak
If you any arcanae memorized and are subject to an attack from a magical effect, *you may use choose to loose one of those memorized arcanae to gain a bonus to defense against that attack equal to the tier of its spell*. If you do, and the attack is not a critical failure, you still suffer the effects of prematurely loosing the arcanae.

### 6) Improved Studies
The time to memorize spells is reduced to 12 minutes plus 10 minutes per spell tier.  
You do not suffer a point of Spell Sickness as a result of using your reaction for Reflexive Casting.
You gain a bonus to your saves against magical effects equal to your [Inte] bonus.

### 7) Arcane Deflection
If you do not have any arcanae memorized and are subject to an attack from a magical effect, you may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to your defense against it equal to your [Inte] bonus. If you do, and the attack is not a critical failure, you accrue a point of Spell Sickness.

### 8) Prepared Spell  
When you finish a full rest, choose a spell you know and a tier up to your current [Inte] bonus. You may cast that spell at the selected tier, without having to make a spellcheck. For all intents and purposes, the spellcheck is considered a success and your points of success are equal to your current [Inte] score. Once cast, you must complete a number full rests equal to the tier of spell prepared this way before doing so again. You may only have a single spell prepared this way and cannot prepare a spell at a tier higher than you have cast it already.

### 9) Modify Magic
When a creature within a number of yards equal to your level attempts a spellcheck, if you know that spell, you may use your reaction to modify the result by an amount up to your [Inte] bonus. If you do, you suffer a point of Spell Sickness.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as an arcanist, you gain the following:  
The time to study a new spell is reduced by half, so long as the minimum tier is less than your level.
When you make a save against a spell you know, you gain a bonus equal to its tier.  
When you cast a spell without using reflexive casting, you gain a bonus to your spellcheck equal to your current [Inte] bonus.
