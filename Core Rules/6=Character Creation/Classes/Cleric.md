### Acolyte
You learn a language of your choice. Additionally, you gain training in two weapons of your choice. You may replace either or both of these with a language of your choice. You learn 2 rites of your choice (see the Liturgy feature below).

### Inspired Magic
Your devotion to crux of your being causes you to radiate inspiration. When a spell references your [Magic] score/bonus, you may use your [Empy] score/bonus.  
Furthermore, when performing a counter-spell check, you may add your [Empy] bonus.

### Liturgy
You have learned several religious rites which can be used as an alternative to wyrdings. Each rite functions as a spell with a few differences;  
* The time to cast the spell is multilpied by the tier of the spell. This increased time accounts for the motions of the ritual, perfomance of any incantations, the drawing of any glyphs or sigils, etc.  
* You must perform a recitation of holy scripture or mantra as you perform the spell. If you cannot hear yourself to ensure the recitation is proper, or are struggling to focus on the recitation, you have disadvantage on the spellcheck. If you cannot perform the recitation, you fail to cast the spell.  
* You must have components (such as incense, an offering of wealth or food, etc.) whose value is the tier of the spell squared, multiplied by 10. Such things must be considered lost as a tribute for fear of incurring divine wrath. The exact nature of the tribute depends on the rite and is at the narrator's discretion.  
* Any spell sickness you would recieve is reduced by 1.  
* A critical success will increase the tier of the cast spell by 1.  
* A critical failure has a 50% chance not to apply its critical failure effect.

You may learn rites from your faith independant of spells. Learning rites takes as much time as learning a new spell otherwise. The time to learn a rite is divided by 10 if you know the associated spell.

### 2) Exogesis
Anytime you successfully prevent the casting of a spell through the use of counterspelling, you gain a +1 on all attacks and defense against that creature for a number of days equal to the tier of the spell. This is not cumulative in benefits, but can be extended through multiple counterspellings.

### 3) Resist Wands
When a wand or staff's magical attack would target you, you may impose disadvantage against that attack. You must rest before doing so again.

### 4) Chalogesis
When you succeed a counterspell check against a creature casting a spell, you may choose to reduce the tier of the spell in place of increasing the casting time by half, if it is cast above minimum tier.

### 4) Spectacular Strike
When you successfully perform a magical attack against a creature which is casting a spell or afflicted by Spell Sickness, it incurs a point of Spell Sickness.

### 6) Optimystical
Anytime you lose hitpoints, you lose an equal number of spell-sickness.
You gain a bonus to your saves against magical effects equal to your [Empy] bonus.

### 7) Divine Favor
When you successfully perform a rite, you may choose to increase the spell's tier by 1. You must perform a long or full rest before doing so again. 

### 8) Prayer  
When you finish a rite, you may choose to delay the activation of the spell by taking on a point of spell-sickness. Before your next long or full rest, you may activate the delayed rite by spending a full round in prayer per spell tier. Once you have delayed a rite this way, you cannot delay another until you have completed a long or full rest.

### 9) Desperate Magic
You may attempt to reflexively cast a spell even if the remaining casting time is greater than 1 action. If you do, roll a d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12. You are considered to have completed that many actions of casting time, but gain spell-sickness equal to the result (even if it exceeded what was required). If this does not allow you to complete the spell, the spell casting ceases.  
You may treat 2 actions as being equal to 1 round, which is 3 seconds.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as an cleric, you gain the following:  
Your maximum hitpoints are increased by 1.  
When performing a rite, you may grant yourself a bonus up to your heroism + [Empy] bonus or heroism + [Will] bonus, but take on spell-sickness equal to the bonus you grant yourself.

#### Splash
If you splash cleric as a member of another class, you gain the following:  
You gain the Chalogesis, Exogesis, and Inspired Magic features.
Choose an attribute. It is increased by 1.
