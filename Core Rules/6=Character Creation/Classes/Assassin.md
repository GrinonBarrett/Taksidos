### Sneak Attack
When you perform an attack against a foe within 15 yards, if it is concentrating on a spell or otherwise distracted in such a way as to not focus on you (like when it is brawling), you gain a +1 bonus to that attack. If that creature was unaware of you, it becomes a 1d4 bonus instead. If it is vulnerable, any bonus you gain from this feature is doubled.

### Tactical Step
Once per round, you may move 1 yard using your primary mode of movement. This does not count as an action and does not count against your movement. You cannot be brawling, immobile, or restrained to do so.

### 2) Weapon Familiarity
You gain a level of training in a weapon of your choice and have specialization in another weapon of your choice.

### 2) False Swipe
Once per round, when you perform a Feint, if a creature within 2 yards performs a reaction in response to it, it does not count against your reaction for the round.  
Additionally, when you perform a Feint against a creature (whether or not it was successful), if it has fewer HP than your level, you know how many hitpoints it currently has.

### 3) Dire Dispose
If a creature performs an about face in response to your attack wounding them, you may use your reaction to peform an additional attack. If it was a melee attack, you may choose one of the following:
* You may automatically apply the appropriate critical hit effect for the type of attack, regardless of whether it was a critical hit already.
* You may close the distance into a brawl. If you do, you may choose to replace your lowest die result with your hoerism.
* You may slam the foe.
* You may shove the foe.

### 3) Tumble
You may grant yourself an advantage to a [Rflx] save or an Athletics check which uses your [Rflx]. You must complete a rest before doing so again.

### 4) Fell Hand
If you successfully perform a sneak attack against a foe, you may roll a d12 and add your heroism. For a number of rounds equal to the result, anytime a creature makes an attack against that foe- they may modify the wound result by 2 steps.

### 4) Pinpoint Strike
When you perform an attack, before rolling the attack, you may use your reaction to grant yourself up to a -4 penalty to the attack. For each point of penalty, if the attack is successful, you gain a +3 bonus for the purposes of determining if it is a critical hit and may modify the rolled wound by one step.  
If you were not detected by the foe, and took at least a -2 penalty this way,you may roll your sneak attack die and add that as an additional bonus for the purposes if determining if it is a critical hit.

### 6) Culling Blow
When you attack a creature afflicted by a Fell Hand, you may choose to modify the wound result by an additional 2 steps.

### 7) Assassin's Training
You gain training in two weapons of your choice.

### 7) Relentless Striker
If a foe would dodge your attack, you may use your reaction to ignore the effects of that dodge. If you do, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack if the attack would not be considered a sneak attack.

### 8) Riposte
Once per round, if you parry an attack and that attack would have been a critical failure, you may perform a melee attack against that foe.  
Additionally, each level of training in your weapon grants you a +1 to your Parry attempts.

### 9) Reaper's Answer
When you attack a creature you may use your reaction to push it towards death. If it has 0 hitpoints remaining, the DV of its incapacitation save is increased by the points of your attack's success. You must complete a long or full rest before doing so again. This cannot affect a creature of undeath.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as an assassin, you gain the following features;  
Your sneak attack bonus, if undetected, is increased to 1d6. 
When you perform a sneak attack against a foe and apply your Fell Hand feature, it lasts for an additional number of rounds equal to the sneak attack bonus of that attack.  
When you perform a sneak attack, you may choose to reduce the sneak attack bonus by any amount. If you do, for each point of bonus reduced this way, you gain a +1 bonus for the purpose of determining a critical hit and can modify the wound result by 1.  
When you press attack against a prone or vulnerable foe, you may choose to gain a bonus to the attack equal to your heroism for the prupose of determining if it is a critical hit. You must rest before you do so again.

#### Splash
If you splash assassin as a member of another class, you gain the Sneak Attack feature, the Culling Blow feature, and training with a weapon of your choice.
