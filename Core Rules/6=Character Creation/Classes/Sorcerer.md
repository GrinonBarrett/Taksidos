### Cantripancy
When you cast a tier 1 spell, you may take on any number of levels of exhaustion. If you do, you gain a 1d12+1 bonus to the spellcheck for each level of exhaustion taken this way.

### Sorcery
You are capable of tapping into the latent magics. When you perform a spell check, a skill check involving the nature of magic, or a save against a magical effect, you gain a bonus equal to your [Fort] bonus.  
Additionally, when you perform a spell check, you may choose to roll 2d12 instead of 1d20, but cannot apply your [Fort] bonus if you do so.  
Furthermore, you may apply your [Fort] bonus to your counterspell checks.

### Spark of Sorcery
You learn a spell of your choice with a minimum tier of 1.

### 2) Intensify Spell
When you perform a spellcheck, you may take on a level of exhasution to increase the tier of the spell being cast by 1. This does not affect the spellcheck result or points of success. It also does not affect whether or not the spell is a failure, critical failure, success, or a critical success. You cannot cause a spell's tier to exceed your heroism this way. You cannot intensify a spell affected by Cantripancy this way.

### 4) Sorcerous Guard
When a spell would inflict an attack against you, you may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to your defense equal to your [Fort] bonus.

### 4) Painful Boon
Anytime you receive a wound, your spell sickness is reduced by 1.

### 7) Glass Shield
When you are attacked, before the attack is rolled, you may choose to take on 3 or more points of Spell-Sickness. If you do, you gain a bonus to defense equal to the Spell-Sickness gained this way. You cannot do this if your current spell-sickness exceeds your level.

### 8) Improved Painful Boon
Your Painful Boon now reduces your Spell-Sickness by 2 each time you are wounded.

### 8) Sorcerai  
The bonus to spell checks you gain from staves for spells you know is increased by 1.
You gain a bonus to your saves against magical effects equal to your [Fort] bonus.  

### 9) Sorcerous Wave
Choose an exotic damage type. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed. You may use your action to produce a ray attack against a foe within a number of yards equal to your level + [Fort] score. This incurs a level of fatigue aginst you, but inflicts an attack against the foe of the chosen type with a bonus equal to your [Fort] bonus for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit. If the attack is a critical hit, you may knock that foe back a number of feet equal to the points of success or knock it prone.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

Anytime you cast a spell affecting a creature, you know how many hitpints it currently possesses.  
When you cast a spell using reflexive casting, you gain a bonus to your spellcheck equal to your [Fort] bonus.
You gain a bonus to saves against magical effects equal to your remaining hitpoints.  
So long as you have any hitpoints remaining, you gain a +1 bonus to defense against magical attacks.
