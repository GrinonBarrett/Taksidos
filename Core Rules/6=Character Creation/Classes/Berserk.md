### Wild One
You are trained in two weapons of your choice.  
Additionally, you may enter a battle-rage as an action or reaction. While in this battle rage;  
* You gain a +1 bonus to the each of your melee attacks, +2 if it is two handed.  
* You gain a +3 bonus to your [Body] (causing your modifier to be increased by +1).
* You gain advantage on opposed [Body] checks.
* If you are unarmored, you gain a +1 bonus to defense against non-melee attacks.  

This trance ends at the end of any round you do not inflict an attack against a foe. When this trance ends, you suffer a level of exhaustion and are dazed for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 + double the number of rounds the trance lasted.

### 2) Furious Blow
The first attack you make each round while in your battle rage gains a bonus equal to your heroism for the purpose of determining if the successful attack is a critical hit.

### 3) Shout
You may use your reaction to produce a shout which affects any number of creatures you can perceive within 3 yards. Those creatures get a -1 penalty to the next d20 they roll before the end of the next round.

### 4) Bash
If you Press Attack to the first attack you make in the round, you also gain a bonus to the attack roll equal to the number of hands your wield the weapon with. If in your battlerage trance, you also gain a bonus for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit equal to the number of hands you wield the weapon with.

### 4) Brutal Momentum
When you attack, if you moved the entirety of your movement (either a typical mode of movement or sprint) since the beginning of the round- you may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to your attack equal to 1/4 the distance in yards you moved since the start of the round or your previous action (whichever is most recent). If you do, and the attack is a critical failure, you are vulnerable until the end of the round.

### 6) Brutal Blow
If you Press Attack while in your battlerage, you gain a bonus to your attack based on the type of attack:
Ranged and One-handed melee weapon attacks, +1.  
Unarmed Attacks and Two-handed melee weapon attacks, +2.

### 7) Relentless Strike
Once per round, when performing a follow up attack or your cleave attacks a creature, you may grant yourself advantage on that single attack roll.

### 7) Warcry
Once per encounter, you may use your reaction to grant any number of other creatures you can perceive a +1 to their next attack roll before the end of the next round. They also gain a +1 to defense against the next attack made against them during this time.

### 8) Barbarity
Your [Body] and [Fort] each improve by 1. Choose two attributes. They are both increased by 1. You gain training in two weapons of your choice.

### 8) Glorious Cry
When you inflict a critical hit, if you expend your reaction to use your Shout or Warcry features, it does not count against your reaction for the round. You may only use one feature for free this way per critical hit.

### 9) Raging Focus
While in your battle rage, if you receive a wound and are not vulnerable, you may choose to become vulnerable until the end of the round. If you do, you may perform an additional reaction this round and gain a +1 to all attack rolls until your take a reaction.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as a berserk, you gain the following:  
You gain training with two weapons of your choice.  
While in your battlerage trance, you gain a +2 bonus to your incapacitation saves.  
Choose two attributes. Each is increased by 1. One of those must be [Body], [Fort], [Rflx] or [Empy].  
You are now affected by your Warcry ability.

#### Splash
If you splash berserk as a member of another class, you gain the ability to enter a battlerage trance and gain the Brutal Momentum feature.
