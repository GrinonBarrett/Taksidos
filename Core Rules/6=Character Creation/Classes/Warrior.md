### Basic Training
Every Warrior receives some training over their lifetime. You are trained in four weapons of your choice. You may include the Shield Proficiency (see below) in these picks. You also have specialization with a weapon of your choice.  
When you inflict a critical hit with an attack, you know how many hitpoints that creature currently has remaining.  
Additionally, choose [Body], [Rflx], or [Fort]. It is improved by 1. Once chosen, this choice cannot be undone.

### Pacing
At the beginning of any encounter, you may choose one of the following:

* **Haste**. You gain a +1 to attacks and opposed checks against foes with a later turn order than yourself.
* **Patience**. You gain a +1 to defense and opposed checks against foes with an earlier turn order than yourself.
* **Caution**. Choose a reaction, you are automatically braced for it during the first round of combat or until you take an action (whichever occurs later).
* **Zeal**. When you Press Attack, you may replace the advantage gained on an attack with getting a bonus equal to your heroism for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.

### Shield Proficiency
Warriors are able to utilize their shield to a greater extent than others. You may use it as a weapon, treating it as a club. You do not benefit from the warrior's weapon mastery of the club when used this way. You can instead gain training with them as though they were a weapon class of their own (shields). If you gain Mastery with it, by specializing (or splashing) in the warrior class, you gain a bonus to beat and parry checks with the shield equal to the shield's bonus. You also gain an additional +1 bonus to defense when blocking.  
You cannot sunder with a shield.

### 2) Bravery
Anytime you make a save against a fear effect, you may roll a d6 and add the result to your total.

### 2) Tactical Step
Once per round, you may move 1 yard using your primary mode of movement. This does not count as an action and does not count against your movement. You cannot be brawling, immobile, or restrained to do so.

### 2) Weight Bearer
Your load limits are increased by a number of pounds equal to your level.

### 3) Focus Strike
When you successfully attack a foe, you may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to the attack equal to your heroism for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.

### 4) Aggressive Way
If you Press Attack to the first attack you make in the round, it does not count against your reaction for the round.

### 6) Warrior's Training
You gain a level of training in two weapons of your choice. Alternatively, you may gain two levels of training in a single weapon or gain a skill of your choice from the following (Athletics, Helmsmanship, Medicine, Riding, Roping, Survival, or Wrestling).

### 7) Riposte
Once per round, if you parry an attack and that attack would have been a critical failure, you may perform a melee attack against that foe.  
Additionally, each level of training in your weapon grants you a +1 to your Parry attempts.

### 7) Skilled Defense
If you are attacked with a weapon or unarmed attack and have a greater total level of training than the attacker, you may use your reaction to prevent them from gaining any benefits of their training. If you have the same level of training, you may choose to prevent them from gaining one specific benefit from their training.

### 8) Hardened Veteran
Choose two attributes. They are both increased by 1. You gain training in two weapons of your choice.  
If you have Expertise training with a weapon (or unarmed attacks) and such an attack is made against you- you gain a +1 bonus to defense against that attack.

### 8) Wholesome Courage
The die rolled for you Bravery feature is now a d8. You may use your reaction to increase it to a d12.

### 9) Battle Instinct
As an action, you may measure up a foe within a number of yards equal to your level. You know how many hitpoints it currently has. You also know this when you Press Attack against a foe. If a foe critically fails to strike you unarmed or with a weapon, you know their level of training in that weapon and are automatically aware of them.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as a warrior, you gain the following:  
If you have specialization or expertise with a weapon, you may train a further level with that weapon to acquire "Warrior Mastery" with that weapon. Doing so enables a benefit unique to that weapon (see table below). You do not need expertise with the weapon to achieve this. 
Additionally, you gain training with a number of weapons equal to your current level. Anytime you gain a new level, you gain training in a weapon of your choice.

#### Splash
If you splash warrior as a member of another class, you gain the same benefits as a warrior that chooses to specialize.

|                        |           |
| Unarmed                | If you score a critical hit against a foe, or attack them from behind, you may have them make an opposed [Body] or [Rflx] check. If they fail, they are knocked prone.

| Flail                  | If the weapon is wound properly, you may ignore the passive benefit a foe gets for having a shield. If they do not benefit from a shield anyway, you gain a +1 to your attack instead and an additional +2 for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit. |

| Pike                   | When you stand to a charge against a foe, its remaining movement (in feet) is divided by the points of success of your attack. Any result below 1 results in it being stopped. If the result is below .5, you may push it back a number of feet equal to your points of success divided by their lost movement (in feet). |
| Pole Axe               | You may choose to incur a penalty to your attack up to -4. If you do, for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit, the attack is treated as having a +2 for each point of penalty incurred this way so long as the attack hits. |
| Spear                  | You ignore the passive benefit a foe gets for having a shield. If they do not benefit from a shield anyway, you gain a +1 to your attack instead and an additional +2 for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.|
| Warpick                | If you damage the foe's armor or inflict a critical hit, you may have the weapon get stuck in the foe- causing it to suffer a -2 penalty to all checks and a -1 penalty to Attack Rolls and Saves until it is removed with a [Body] Check of 12.

If it returns to your own space, you catch it. |
