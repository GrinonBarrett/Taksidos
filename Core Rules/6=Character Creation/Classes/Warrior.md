### Basic Training
Every Warrior receives some training over their lifetime. You are trained in four weapons of your choice. You may include the Shield Proficiency (see below) in these picks. You also have specialization with a weapon of your choice.  
When you inflict a critical hit with an attack, you know how many hitpoints that creature currently has remaining.  
Additionally, choose [Body], [Rflx], or [Fort]. It is improved by 1. Once chosen, this choice cannot be undone.

### Pacing
At the beginning of any encounter, you may choose one of the following:

* **Haste**. You gain a +1 to attacks against foes with a later turn order than yourself.
* **Patience**. You gain a +1 to defense against foes with an earlier turn order than yourself.
* **Caution**. Choose an action, you are automatically braced for it during the first round of combat.

### Shield Proficiency
Warriors are able to utilize their shield to a greater extent than others. You may use it as a weapon, treating it as a club. You do not benefit from the warrior's weapon mastery of the club when used this way. You can instead gain training with them as though they were a weapon class of their own (shields). If you gain Mastery with it, by specializing (or splashing) in the warrior class, you gain a bonus to beat and parry checks with the shield equal to the shield's bonus. You also gain an additional +1 bonus to defense when blocking.  

### 2) Tactical Step
Once per round, you may move 1 yard using your primary mode of movement. This does not count as an action and does not count against your movement.

### 2) Weight Bearer
Your load limits are increased by a number of pounds equal to your level.

### 2) Bravery
Anytime you make a save against a fear effect, you may roll a d6 and add the result to your total.

### 3) Focus Strike
When you successfully attack a foe, you may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to the attack equal to your heroism for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.

### 4) Aggressive Way
If you Press Attack to the first attack you make in the round, it does not count against your reaction for the round.

### 6) Warrior's Training
You gain a level of training in two weapons of your choice. Alternatively, you may gain two levels of training in a single weapon.

### 7) Riposte
Once per round, if you parry an attack and that attack would have been a critical failure, you may perform a melee attack against that foe.  
Additionally, each level of training in your weapon grants you a +1 to your Parry attempts.

### 7) Skilled Defense
If you are attacked with a weapon or unarmed attack and have a greater total level of training than the attacker, you may use your reaction to prevent them from gaining any benefits of their training. If you have the same level of training, you may choose to prevent them from gaining one specific benefit from their training.

### 8) Hardened Veteran
Choose two attributes. They are both increased by 1. You gain training in two weapons of your choice.

### 8) Wholesome Courage
The die rolled for you Bravery feature is now a d8. You may use your reaction to increase it to a d12.

### 9) Battle Instinct
As an action, you may measure up a foe within a number of yards equal to your level. You know how many hitpoints it currently has. You also know this when you Press Attack against a foe. If a foe critically fails to strike you unarmed or with a weapon, you know their level of training in that weapon and are automatically aware of them.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as a warrior, you gain the following:  
If you have specialization or expertise with a weapon, you may train a further level with that weapon to acquire mastery with that weapon. Doing so enables a benefit unique to that weapon (see chart below).  
Additionally, you gain training with a number of weapons equal to your current level. Anytime you gain a new level, you gain training in a weapon of your choice.

#### Splash
If you splash warrior as a member of another class, you gain the same benefits as a warrior that chooses to specialize.

|                        |           |
| Unarmed                | If you score a critical hit against a foe, or attack them from behind, you may have them make an opposed [Body] or [Rflx] check. If they fail, they are knocked prone. |
| Longsword              | In place of performing a movement, you may perform an attack. |

| Spear                  | You ignore the passive benefit a foe gets for having a shield. If they do not benefit from a shield anyway, you gain a +1 to your attack instead and an additional +2 for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.|
| Hand Axe               | If you fail to harm a foe with your attack action, you may use your reaction to attack another foe within range. Cannot be used in response to a cleave or attack as a result of a reaction. |

Against an unarmord foe, you instead inflict an additional wound.|
| Club                   | On a critical hit, you may shift the wound result an additional step. |
| Madu                   | You gain a +3 bonus to parries made with your main hand and a +2 bonus to parries made with your off hand. You may actually use multiple Madu to parry, gaining the bonus for one and a +1 for each additional madu, so long as the additional madu are not used for attacks during this phase. |

| Greatsword             | When you cleave with this weapon, you do not have disadvantage on attacks made within less than half of the weapon's range and may choose to extend the arc to 270 degress (your front and both sides). If you do, you may choose to either suffer a level of fatigue, become prone until the end of the next round, or become vulnerable until the end of the next round. |
| Maul                   | When you inflict a critical hit or damage the foe's armor, the foe is knocked prone. |
| Pike                   | When you stand to a charge against a foe, its remaining movement (in feet) is divided by the points of success of your attack. Any result below 1 results in it being stopped. If the result is below .5, you may push it back a number of feet equal to your points of success divided by their lost movement (in feet). |
|                        |           |
| Javelin                | If you attack a foe with a shield, and your attack is blocked or your attack roll is within 1 step of the minimum required to harm the foe, you may have the javelin become lodged in that shield- preventing it from being used to block and making them vlunerable while the shield is equipped. If they do not benefit from a shield anyway, you gain a +1 to your attack instead and an additional +1 for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit. |

If it returns to your own space, you catch it. |

| Musket           | You gain a 1d8 bonus to the attack for the purpose of determining if the successful attack is a critical hit. If the attack was aimed, 1d12 bonus instead. |

|                        |           |
| Wand                   | You may treat a wand as a melee weapon with a range of 2 yards for all purposes. In place of comparing your [Body] to the foe's [Body] for the +1 bonus, you may compare the wand's attribute to their [Body]. |
