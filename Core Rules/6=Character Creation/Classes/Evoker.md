### 2) Empowered Strikes

### 2) Step Dash
Once per round as an action, if you performed a Ki Step during the previous phase, you may perform a movement.

### 3) Ki Blast Volley

Choose an attribute. It is improved by 1. You gain training in a weapon of your choice.

### 6) Superior Ki Power
When you hit a foe with your Ki Blast, Empowered Strike, or Empowered Slam- you may apply one of the below effects by using your reaction:  
* The foe is knocked back. Treat as a shove, with you using the points of success on the attack in place of your weight (in stones).
* You attempt to knock the foe off balance, causing an opposed [Body] check. If you succeed, the foe is knocked prone.
* You take aim against that foe.
* If foe is within 1 yard, you may appear in any unoccupied space adjacent to them. You may choose to have this begin a brawl or not.
* You know how many hitpoints it has remaining so long as they are fewer than your attack total.

As an action or reaction, you may charge your own internal energy to a particular frequency. Until the end of the next round, you may use your action or reaction to produce a ray attack against a foe within a number of yards equal to your level + [Body] score. This incurs a level of fatigue aginst you, but inflicts a ki attack against the foe with a bonus equal to your [Will] bonus for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit. If it is a critical hit, it also applies the critical effect of the chosen damage type. This does mean it could apply two independant instances of the Ki attack critical hit effect.
