### Spell Points
You have a pool of spell points which represent your ability to draw from the weave. This pool takes time to recover, regaining 1 point upon completing a long rest and half of your missing spell points upon completing a full rest.

### Magicraft
You are capable of tapping into the latent magics. When you perform a spell check, a skill check involving the nature of magic, or a save against a magical effect, you may spend a single spell point to gain a bonus equal to your [Will] bonus.  
Additionally, when you perform a spell check, you may choose to roll 3d6 instead of 1d20.  
When a spell references your [Magic] score/bonus, you may use your [Will] score/bonus.  
Furthermore, you may add your [Will] bonus to your counterspell checks.

### 2) Spell Weaving
You can attempt to cast a spell by expending spell points in place of performing a typical spellcheck. You choose how many spell points you wish to invest into the spell. Then determine the spell's demand as indicated with the chart below. If your total spell point investment equals or exceeds the demand, the spell is cast. A failure provides a point of Spell Sickness. A spell cast this way is never a critical success or critical failure. The spell is always considered to have a check total equal to the minimum result required to cast the spell plus your [Will] bonus.

| Tier | Demand|
| ---- | ------|
|  1  | 1d3  |
|  2  | 1d4+1  |
|  3   | 1d6+1  |
|  4   | 1d8+2 |
|  5   | 1d10+2 |
|  6   | 1d12+2 |
|  7+  | 1d20 + Xd4|

Where X is the total tier beyond 6th.

### 4) Magi's Focus
When you perform a spell check, you may spend 2 spell points to simply use your [Will] in place of rolling the d20. If you would have had advantage on the check, you roll 1d6 and add the result. If you would have had disadvantage, you roll 1d6 and subtract it.

### 4) Resist Wands
When a wand or staff's magical attack would target you, you may impose disadvantage against that attack. You must rest before doing so again.

### 7) Counter Surge
When you are attacked by another creature, if you are not casting a spell or using your concentration, you may use your reaction to perform an attack against that creature by spending 2 spell points. The attack will be of the same range and type. If their attack was successful, your attack gains a bonus equal to your [Will] bonus.

### 8) Archmagi  
The bonus to spell checks you gain from staves for spells you know is increased by 1.
You gain a bonus to your saves against magical effects equal to your [Will] bonus.

### 8) Modify Strike
You may use your reaction to expend your use of the Resist Wands feature to grant any creature you can perceive within a number of yards a set defense value against a magical attack. The defense would be equal to your [Will] score.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

### 9) Modify Magic
You may use your reaction to expend the use of your Resist Wands feature to modify a creature's save against a magical effect by up to your [Will] bonus.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as a magi, you gain the following:  
Your pool of spell points is increased by your [Will] bonus.  
When you cast a spell using reflexive casting, you gain a bonus to your spellcheck equal to your [Will] bonus.
Choose an exotic damage type. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed. You may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to your defense against an attack of that type equal to your [Will] bonus. This does not apply to the effect of poisons or continuously acting effects.  

#### Splash
If you splash magi as a member of another class, you gain the following:  
The Magicraft feature.  
You have a pool of spell points equal to half of your level. You recover 1 on a long rest and half your missing spell points on a full rest.  
Choose an exotic damage type. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed. You may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to your defense against an attack of that type equal to your [Will] bonus. This does not apply to the effect of poisons or continuously acting effects (such as exotic items).
