### Conjury
The invoker may have a number of serviles that give their service to the invoker. These serviles have a special bond with the invoker. The invoker may only entreat the services of so many serviles as limited by their conjury. Once an invoker has reached this limit, they cannot acquire any additional allies of this nature. This is the total number of serviles that may serve you at any time.

### Serviles
You have a bond with a number serviles. Your serviles each get their own turn during encounters, but cannot tag with other creatures. Each servile takes their turn simultaneously. When rolling for initiative, they will always take their turn after yours. They act of their own accord, but will obey your command. Commanding any number of serviles is an action or reaction. Commanding all serviles to do the same thing counts as a single order, but otherwise each servile is which is to follow an order is treated as being given an individual order. Once a servile is lost, a new one can be recruited by some means appropriate to the type of servile. You may only have lesser serviles follow you.  
Serviles function as creatures with a limited pool of hitpoints. When a servile is damaged while no hitpoints remain, it is destroyed.

### 2) Dominion
Your powers have an origin in some aspect of magic. Determine what that origin is. You and your serviles can gain benefits based on this. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed.

### 2) Engage
Once per round, you may use your reaction to impose advantage on an attack or check made by a servile which you can perceive.

### 3) Bonded Magic
Anytime a creature within a number of yards equal to your level receives Spell-Sickness, you may use your reaction to redirect up to half of that to yourself.  
When a spell references your [Magic] score/bonus, you may use your [Prcp] score/bonus.  
Furthermore, when performing a counter-spell check, you may add your [Prcp] bonus.

### 4) Further Training
You gain training in two weapons of your choice. You may choose to learn a language in place of either training. Alternatively, you may choose to gain a skill of your choice instead of getting any training in weapons or languages.

### 6) Greater Servile
Your power and focus has honed to the point that you may have a single greater servile follow you.

##### The Grave
Your power comes from the veil of life and death itself. In place of giving a command, you may do one of the following:  
• As an action, you may target an undead or ephemeral creature which can perceive you and which you can perceive. Perform an opposed [Will] check. If you have a success, it is dazed until the end of the next round. If you have a critical success, it is vulnerable during this time.
