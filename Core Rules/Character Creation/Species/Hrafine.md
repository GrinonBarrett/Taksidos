### Special Features

**Hrafine Knowledge**: You gain proficiency in the Lore skill and a skill of your choice.

**Hrafine Form**: A hrafine cannot wear armor. Its claws can be used to hold items, but it can only use items as though it had a single hand.

**Nimble Flight**: While flying, the hrafine adds its [Rflx] bonus to its defense against all attacks made at a range of 5 yards or greater.

**Magical Resistance**: Anytime you would perform a save against a magical effect, you add half of your level to your attribute bonus.

**Dire Form**: As a full round action you may transform into your Dire form. While in the dire form, you are affected by the following  
 • +1 [Body]  
 • You sprout four claws. These claws are treated as off hands. A pair of dire claws may be used to make a slashing attack.  You may attacks with both pairs as an action, but have disadvantage on each attack.
 • Your flight speed is reduced by half.  
 • You cannot use items in your claws. 
You resume your original form when incapacitated or spend a full round to resume it. You suffer a level of exhaustion when you resume your original form.

**Mimicry**: A hrafine can imitate a sound akin to another avian creature. Any creature which hears it must make a [Prcp] save with a DV equal to the hrafine's [Fort] or [Prcp] + its level or believe the intended creature is making the intended sound. More extreme attempts, such as specific calls of exotic birds or the screech of a much different avian such as the aretheus are at the narrator’s discretion.

**Dive**: You may choose to dive towards a target as a special action, dropping between 20-40 yards. If you dive into range of a target, you gain advantage on your unarmed attacks (including dire claw attacks) against that target during this round. You lose your Nimble Flight during any round you dive.
