### Special Features

**Great Education**: You gain proficiency in three skills of your choice.

**Limbless Form**: Helicidoi do not have arms, legs, or other appendages. They may only hold something with their mouth, allowing it to function as a hand.

**Shelled Form**: A helicidoi cannot wear armor and instead is considered unarmored with a defense bonus equal to its heroisim.

**Tuck in Shell**: A helicidai may retreat into (or come out of) its shell as an action. While in its shell, the helidoi is considered prone. Additionally, its defense is its level +10. Furthermore, the only wounds which may be dealt to it are biased wounds. If it has no such wounds options remaining, it is no longer limited to only receiving biased wounds.

**Eye Stalks**: Helicidoi can rotate their vision. This occurs when rotations would during the round. The helicidai can rotate their vision during the same or different phases that they rotate their body. Their eye stalks may each only rotate up to 90 degrees left or right per phase.

**Mucous**: The body of a helicdai is coated in a  mucous which is constantly being produced. This confers several advantages  
 • Anytime you would need to make a [Fort] or [Rflx] save as a result of a fluid you are submerged in, you gain an advantage on that save.  
 • You may spend a minute coating specific points of a surface in your mucous manually to grant yourself a +2 bonus to checks/saves pertaining to climbing or retaining your balance on that surface. Any creature which does not have the Mucous feature which crosses the path has a -2 penalty to such checks/saves unless they allow the mucous to dissipate which does so after a minute in normal air or water.  
 • While you are unarmored, your defense against all attacks is increased by 1. Against unarmed attacks, it is instead increased by 2.

**Drop Resistance**: When inflicting attacks against the helicidai for falling, halve the total umber of attacks beyon the first three.

**Magical Resistance**: Anytime you would perform a save against a magical effect, you gain a bonus equal to half of your level.

**Odd Mind**: Psychic attacks against you have disadvantage. Anytime you would make a save against an effect which would alter your state of mind, you may roll an additional die. Each odd result grants a +2 bonus.
