## MYRATHIRIN
Sentient arachnids which have played a prominent role in the Lazine Empire, the myrathirin have a few advantages. They are known for their speed and climbing ability. They lack manipulators on their hands, thus are known for being less capable with certain tasks. They do have fairly powerful innate psychic abilities compared to other creatures. Their telepathy typically leads them to xenophobia as they find themselves more easily capable of utilizing it with others of their kind, though it does not completely replace speech in their communities.

### Special Features

**Some Education**: You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice.

**Arachnid Form**: Myrathirin cannot wear unless it is tailored to the arachnid form. This raises the cost of the armor by one and a half.

**Strikers**: Myrathirin do not have manipulators (hands) on the end of their limbs, instead they end in points (known as strikers). This prevents them from using equipment unless it specifically states it can be used by myrathirin. This also grants them an alternative to their standard unarmed attack which is treated as a piercing attack with a range of one half-meter.

**Mild Telepathy**: A myrathirin can convey a single sentence of information during each phase. This has a range of 5 yards. If communicating with another Myrathirin, the range is increased by a number of yards equal to the lowest of either’s [Inte] score.

**Mind Spike**: Once per encounter, a myrathirin may unleash a spike of psychic energy. It must choose to use [Will] or [Inte] when using this. The myrathirin targets a creature it is aware of within a number of feet equal to the chosen attribute. The target must succeed an opposed check of the selected ability score or be knocked back a number of feet equal to double the points of failure. If the myrathirin’s ability score is higher, the target is also knocked prone on a failure.  
The myrathirin receives a level of exhaustion when it uses this feature.

**Psychoresistance**: A myrathirin's defense against psychic attacks can never be lower than their heroism.
