### Special Features

**Lucertolan Education**: You gain proficiency in Survival and any skill of your choice.

**Quick Study**: This feature is at the Narrator’s discretion. The experience required for you to level up is reduced by 25%. If the Narrator determines this is not feasible, you simply ignore the Ability Score Modification feature of this species.

**Small Frame**: Lucertolans can use most equipment just fine, but armor must be made especially for them. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for a lucertolan cost half again as it would typically and weighs two thirds what it would normally.

**Weak**: Your weight capacity is reduced to ½ at all load levels.

**Thermal Regulation**: So long as it would not deal damage to you, you are comfortable in any temperature.

**Tribe**: You are born into a tribe. Your time living among the tribe has granted certain features. Once this is determined, it cannot be changed.

#### TRIBES

**Draconic Tribe**: You grew up worshiping a dragon, who is supposed to have blessed your tribe. The narrator will tell you of the Dragon and their name.  
You learn a spell which has been granted by the teachings of the tribes elders, based on the wisdom of the dragon. Additionally, the narrator selects an exotic damage type as appropriate to that dragon. Attacks of that type have disadvantage against you.

**Natural Tribe**: If the tribe is natural, your capacity for individual learning is based on your level and not your heroism. Additionally, unarmed attacks have disadvantage against you.

**Seaborne Tribe**: Your swim speed is increased by 2 yards. You may hold you breath twice as long as normal.

**Desolated Tribe**: If the tribe is desolated, they have been decimated and returned to a false-life by dark magic. You become Undead, not Humanoid. Choose 3 of your attributes. They are each reduced by 1.  
You also are subject to the following;  
    • Desolated lucertolan do not need to eat, sleep or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
    • You are not affected by disease, poison, or venom. Effects which deal toxic damage do not affect you.  
    • Necrotic and Fire attacks against you have advantage.
    • You are immune to bloodloss.  
    • All forms of healing which would affect you have a 1 in 3 chance not to affect you unless they explicitly affect undead.
