**Creature Type**: Mukitsuan are infigura.

**Size**: Mukitsuan can stretch up to 6 feet or compact down to 1 foot. They are between 25-35 pounds. They can be treated as small or medium creatures.

Choose two attributes. Each are increased by 1.

**Climb Speed**: You may climb up to 2.5 yards per move, presuming it is reasonable terrain to climb. 

**Swim speed**: You may swim up to 1 yard per move, presuming the water isn’t too rough.

### Special Features

**Comproficiency**: You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice. You may replace one or both skill proficiencies with comptency in two languages each.

**Amorphous**: Mukitsuan don’t retain a single cohesive shape but are instead in the form of a glob of snotty material. This confers some strange properties to it.  
 • Immunity to falling and knockback damage.  
 • Obstacles that would reduce the speed of the mukitsuan have only half of their normal effect unless they specifically affect amorphous creatures as well.  
 • All forms of non-magical attack against the mukitsuan have disadvantage.  
 • Anytime a spell would be cast against the mukitsuan that would affect its form, shape, composition, or mental state- the mukitsuan gains a bonus to its saves against that effect equal to its level.  
 • The mukitsuan cannot be grappled.  
 • While the mukitsuan has a creature grappled, it can treat that creature as being unarmored for the purpose of attacking it.  
 • The mukitsuan is capable of traveling through any opening small enough to stick both of one’s hands.  
 • Cannot use armor, shields, or any item unless it mentions it can be used by the mukitsuan. When attacked, treat as wearing gambeson.  
 • Receives wounds, but no effect from them. If a creature would be able to modify a wound result against the mukitsuan, it may choose to destroy one of its appendages. If it does, a new appendage will automatically regrow at the end of the next round.

**Infigural Nature**: Being infigura, mukitsuan have several advantages.  
 • Immunity to all poisons and diseases, including toxic damage, except those that specifically affect infigura.  
 • Immunity to the effects of bloodloss.  
 • Immunity to fatigue from outside sources. A mukitsuan still suffers from fatigue brought on as a result of sorcery.  
 • Immunity to sleep.  
 • Immunity to effects which cause asphyxiation.  
 • Immunity to effects which would inflict the prone condition, unless it specifically targets infigura.  
 • Does not require sleep to rest, but must still manage to relax and unwind as other creatures would.  
 • Immunity to incapacitation, but is destroyed when wounded with no remaining hitpoints.

**Minimal Sensing**: The mukitsuan is, in the most technical sense, blind. It is also devoid of the senses of smell and hearing. Instead it relies on sensing vibrations and its ability to taste everything it comes in contact with. Anytime it would attempt a check or save based on perceiving something, it has disadvantage (likewise, it should get advantage against illusions based on such stimuli). If it would rely on multiple missing senses, it suffers an additional -2 penalty for each total sense. If it is touching or tasting something, it does not have any issues identifying it.

**Mucous**: The body of a mukitsuan is coated in a  mucous which is constantly being produced. This confers several advantages  
 • Anytime you would need to make a [Fort] or [Rflx] save as a result of a fluid you are submerged in, you gain advantage on that save.  
 • You may spend a minute coating specific points of a surface in your mucous manually to grant yourself a +2 bonus to checks/saves pertaining to climbing or retaining your balance on that surface. Any creature which does not have the Mucous feature which crosses the path has a -2 penalty to such checks/saves unless they allow the mucous to dissipate which does so after a minute in normal air or water.  
• While you are unarmored, your defense against all attacks is increased by 1. Against unarmed attacks, it is instead increased by half of your current level.

**Weak**: Your weight capacity is reduced to ½ at all load levels.

**Resistance**: All forms of acid, necrotic, and psychic damage dealt to you have disadvantage.

**Adaptable Appendages**: The mukitsuan has two appendages which may each change their form as a full round action. Each appendage may have one of the following functions at anytime.  
 • Whipping Tentacle  
This appendage may be used for unarmed attacks within 1 yard. Additionally, on a critical hit, the mukitsuan may attempt to grapple the struck foe as though they were brawling.  
 • Crude Eye  
The appendage functions like an eye stalk, with a rudimentary ability to perceive and differentiate bewteen colors and light. The mukitsuan can rotate their vision gained by this. This occurs when rotations would during the round. The mukitsuan can rotate their vision during the same or different phases that they rotate their body. Their eyes stalks may only rotate up to 90 degrees left or right. Two eyestalks will grant a +1 to vision related checks and saves.  
 • Tingler  
The appendage takes a rattle like appearance, which functions like an ear. Two tinglers will grant a +1 to check/saves related to hearing.  
 • Noisehole  
The appendage takes a hollow form capable of subtle vibrations and the movement of air- allowing it to speak as though it had a throat and mouth. It may have a thick accent. This is the only way a mukitsuan can speak. Two noiseholes will grant a -1 to the sanity of your companion who must listen.  
 • Sniffer  
The appendage is capable of smelling just like a normal nose. Two sniffers grants a +1 bonus to checks/saves related to smell.  
 • Manipulator  
The appendage can functions as a hand. It suffers a penalty to any check or attack roll involving an item in this manipulator equal to the weight in pounds of the item. A manipulator is treated as an offhand in all cases.  
 • Shooter  
The appendage becomes capable of blasting a foe with mucous. As an action, a target within 4 meters must succeed a [Prcp] save or be covered in mucous. It gains a bonus to its save equal to the number of meters in distance from the mukitsuan. The DV is equal to your level + your [Rflx] bonus.
