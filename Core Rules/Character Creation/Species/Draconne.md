### Special Features

**Rough Hide**: A draconne cannot use armor unless it states otherwise. When unarmored, the draconne is treated as wearing maile.

**Fumbling Claws**: A draconne has difficulties accomplishing tasks involving items in the hands, due to their claws. Anytime they perform such a check, they treat their attribute as being halved. Additionally, they have disadvantage on attack rolls made with two handed weapons.

**Magically Entwined**: The unusual nature of a draconne leaves them subject to the affect of magic. You do not apply your heroism to saves against magical effects.

**Quadrachroma**: Draconne have 4 chroma in their eyes. As a result they gain a +3 to all [Prcp] checks involving sight.

**Breath Weapon**: Draconne are capable of exhaling a line of flames, as an action. The line is a number of yards in length equal to your level and is half a foot high and wide. Anything caught within the line suffers a Fire attack. Once the draconne has used this ability, it cannot do so again for 1d4+2 hours.  
Alternatively, you may cause the breath weapon to take the form of a cone. Doing so reduces the length to one third of its usual length as you sweep your head side to side.

**Winged Lunge**: As an action or reaction, a draconne may push itself away from a surface or object capable of bearing its weight and perform a small burst of flight. It is treated as performing a jump, with the maximum height and distance doubled. This movement counts towards remaining airborne.

**Vicious Bite**: As an additional option when you succeed a critical success while brawling, you may bite the foe whom you are brawling. This is treated as a Biting attack (ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling).

**Tail Sweep**: Once per round, when your unarmed attack would be a critical hit or you slam a brawling opponent, you may use your reaction to do one of the following;

* You may have that creature perform a [Body] save with a DV equal to your [Body] score plus your level. On a failure, that creature is knocked prone until the end of the round. On a critical failure, it is also vulnerable during this time.  
If it has a greater [Rflx] score than you, it gains advantage on the save.

* Inflict a Club attack against that creature.

###### Optional Rule: While unarmored, a Draconnes defense against Cold and Fire attacks could be swapped. If the narrator approves, this decision should be noted. It cannot be undone.
