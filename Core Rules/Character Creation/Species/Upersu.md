### Special Features

**Upersun Capablities**: You gain proficiency in Ropework and any one of the following skills (Athletics, Lore, Survival, Wrestling). You have a knack for vigilance.

**Arachnid Form**: Upersu cannot wear armor unless it is tailored to the arachnid form. This raises the cost of the armor by one and a half.

**Fumblesome Manipulators**: While there are grippers on each of the upersu's legs, they cannot be used with any fine manipulation. Additionally, only the foreward most pair is capable of even the gross movements resmbling arms. Any checks or attack rolls made involving items in these "hands" has disadvantage.

**Great Leap**: Your jumping distance is doubled.

**Web**: The upersu can produce up to 10 yards of silk as a special action. This silk functions as a rope. The silk ignores the burden of the upersu climbing or traveling with it. It is treated as rope a weight of .5 lb per yard and strength of 3,000. The web weakens over time, losing 50 points of strength per minute. All forms of force and crushing damage dealt to the silk is halved.
 
Once the upersu has produced all of this silk, it cannot produce any more until it rests. It recuperates 1d2+3 feet during a long rest and 2d6+6 during a full rest.

**Webbed Grip**: The upersu may expend some of its web to ensure a strong grip on an item. By expending a yard's worth of web it can fix the item to its hand. This requires a [Body] check to undo as a full round action. The upersu itself may choose to do so as a special action instead or to gain advantage on the check. This grip lasts for an hour, negates the disadvantage on weapon attacks, and grants advantage on checks involving grip.

**Wrap**: As an additional option when you succeed a critical success while brawling, if the foe is prone, you may expend web to restrain the foe. The exact amount required is to be determined by the narrator (a manfolk sized creature should require 6 yards). A restrained creature must succeed a [Body] check to break free. It can also be freed if the web is destroyed. As a full round action, an additional layer of web (requiring as much as the first), can be wrapped around such a restrained creature, imposing disadvantage on the [Body] check and requiring the outer layer itself to be destroyed.
