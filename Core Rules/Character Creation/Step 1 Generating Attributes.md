#### GENERATING ABILITY SCORES
There are a few methods to generate ability scores.

##### Standard

Each attribute starts at 8. Roll a d4 for each attribute and apply it as a bonus. Then choose an ability score. Roll an additional d6 and add it to the total for that ability score. An ability score cannot exceed 18 this way.
###### This method is recommended as the compromise between giving characters some basic functionality while also providing meaningful room to grow.

##### Substandard

Each attribute starts at 4. Roll a d4 for each attribute and apply it as a bonus. Then choose an ability score. Roll an additional 2d4 and add it to the total for that ability score. An ability score cannot exceed 18 this way.
###### A tougher variation of the standard method. Only recommended for those wanting to run gritty low power games. The d6 is bumped to 2d4 to compensate for the lower average affecting what would be a key attributes.

##### Simple Swing

For each attribute, roll 3d8. Drop the lowest die result. Each attribute is increased by 1.
###### A fun method for generating characters to use in a quick and dirty dungeon delving campaign.

##### Custom Roll
Roll 20d6, recording each result individually. Assign each die to an attribute. Each attribute is increased by 2. This cannot increase an attribute beyond 18.
###### Wild, directed, likely overpowered.

##### Moderate Swing
For each attribute, roll 4d6. Drop the lowest.
###### A simple solution from a more civilized age.

##### Stable
For each attribute, roll 4d4. Select three of your attributes, they are increased by 1 each.
###### Like the Moderate Swing method, but with higher averages.

##### Custom Build
You have 80 points to distribute among your ability scores as you choose. To improve any attribute beyond 12, 2 points must be spent per per point of ability score. For example, to have an ability score of 15 costs 21 points.
###### A good measure to help bring balance to each player’s ability score spread while also cutting out the possibility of lady luck’s displeasure.
