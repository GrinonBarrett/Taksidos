## SIZE CATEGORY
All creatures have a size category. For the purposes of trampling, these size categories can be used to determine if a creature is small enough to be trampled. A narrator may find other uses for these size categories as well. A narrator is free to simply use their judgement when deciding trampling though.

Size Categories are as follows:  
**I**nsurmountable (larger than 10 miles)  
**J**ormungous (between 1 to 10 miles)  
**T**itanous (up to a mile)  
**B**ig (up to 1000 feet)  
**H**uge (up to 250 feet)  
**G**reat (roughly 24-50 feet in length)  
**L**arge (roughly 7 - 24 feet)  
**M**edium (roughly 3-7 feet)  
**S**mall (roughly between 1-3 feet)  
**D**iminutive (smaller than small)

## Shapes of Effect
Sometimes an effect will affect an area rather than a specific target.

##### Cone
A cone extends out from the point of origin and will alway expand to be as tall and wide as the distance from the point of origin.

##### Fan
A fan extends directly from the point point of origin. It is considered a 2 dimensional plane. Its width expands out from the point of origin and is as wide as the distance from the point of origin.

##### Hemisphere
Like a sphere, split in half.

##### Inverted Cone
Functions as a cone, however the center of the base exists at the point of origin with the shape tapering out as it extends from the point of origin.

##### Line
A line extends directly from the point of origin. A line always has its length, height, and width defined by the effect.

##### Semifan
Like a fan, but the width of any point is always half of the length from the point of origin.

##### Mikrofan
Like a fan, but the width of any point is always one-third of its length.

##### Sphere
A sphere extends from the point of origin in all directions out to the distance dictated by the effect.
