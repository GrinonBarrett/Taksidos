#### SIZE CATEGORY
All creatures have a size category. For the purposes of trampling, these size categories can be used to determine if a creature is small enough to be trampled. A narrator may find other uses for these size categories as well. A narrator is free to simply use their judgement when deciding trampling though.

Size Categories are as follows:  
**I**nsurmountable (larger than 10 miles)  
**J**ormungous (between 1 to 10 miles)  
**T**itanous (up to a mile)  
**B**ig (up to 1000 feet)  
**H**uge (up to 250 feet)  
**G**reat (roughly 24-50 feet in length)  
**L**arge (roughly 7 - 24 feet)  
**M**edium (roughly 3-7 feet)  
**S**mall (roughly between 1-3 feet)  
**D**iminutive (smaller than small)
