##### Multiply your rent by living conditions
Squalor, 1x  
There is no privacy, bathing, or restroom and your space is limited. If it is a house, it is likely condemned.  
It takes twice as much time to rest in these conditions.  
Slum, 1.5x  
Like squalor but you have access to some kind of lavatory or bathing- but likely not both.  
It times half again as long to rest in these conditions.  
Adequate, 2x  
Like a slum if you had access to bathing and a lavatory.  
Good, 3x  
Adequate, but you also get some privacy.  
Fine, 5x  
Your abode is of a quality nature.  
Luxurious, 12x  
You have space enough and the common comforts.
