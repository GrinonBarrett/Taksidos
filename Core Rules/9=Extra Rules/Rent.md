## Rents
At times, the adventurers will need a place to stay for more than a day or two.

$30 a week for a bed.  
$60 a week for a closet.  
$110 a week for a room.  
$450 a month for a shack.  
$700 a month for a 2-bedroom house.  
$1,500 a month for a house capable of housing a small family.  
$3,600 a month for a house that a larger family might call home.  

Anything that can be rented for a week can be rented for the night at 1/3 the weekly rate (so a bed for a night is $10).

##### Multiply your rent by living conditions
**Squalor**, 1x  
There is no privacy, bathing, or restroom and your space is limited. If it is a house, it is likely condemned.  
It takes twice as much time to rest in these conditions.  
**Slum**, 1.5x  
Like squalor but you have access to some kind of lavatory or bathing- but likely not both.  
It takes half again as long to rest in these conditions.  
**Adequate**, 2x  
Like a slum if you had access to bathing and a lavatory.  
**Good**, 3x  
Adequate, but you also get some privacy.  
**Fine**, 5x  
Your abode is of a quality nature.  
**Luxurious**, 12x  
You have space enough and the common comforts.


##### Multiply the above result by the popularity of the area
**Backwood**, 0.5x  
A place like this is rarely to have travelers so it should be counted as a blessing there is even a place for you to stay. Some cloisters may expect donations in return for their shelter, equating to something like this in terms of value.  
**Hamlet**, 1x  
You are essentially renting in a neighborhood with no direct road access between two or three families that have been here for a couple generations. Avoid drama and enjoy.  
**Village**, 1.5x  
Somewhere off the beaten path. It's not an uncommon place for adventurers.  
**Town**, 2x  
This is likely where those from nearby villages come to do business. Always a bit more expensive, but its easier to find basic supplies.  
**City**, 2.75x  
Pricey but convenient. You could find most mundane items and some good food around these parts. You can probably also find some oddjobs or exotic items.  
**Capitol**, 3x  
The largest cities or even a fortress town. You can find almost anything here.

##### Wagon/Caravan Lots
Lots can be rented outside of town typically, but within walking distance. No need to multiply by quality, but the price is certainly affected by the size of the local settlement.

$150 a week for a single wagon lot.  
$500 a week for a four wagon lot.
