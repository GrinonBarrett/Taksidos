Legendary spells are named for their creator. These spells are listed by creator rather than letter. Legendary spells cannot simply be learned by a character. The creators' notes are often losst or buried and require deciphering. Alternatively, if such a magician is still alive, direct tualege could allow a character to learn such a spell.

### Hencor (2
A war wizard of some renown in old texts. Little is known about him and the records of his magic are written in military accounts.

#### Hencor's Needles

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a stream of needles directed at a foe within range, inflicting a piercing attack against them. On a critical hit, some of the needles will bounce off of the target, allowing you to direct them to inflict an attack against another foe within 1 yard of the original.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you produce an additional original attack. A creature may only be hit by a single original attack and a single bounced attack by this spell.

**Critical Failure**: Your conjured needles do not actually attack the foe, instead bouncing off of them harmlessly and inflicting a piercing attack against you. Each tier beyond minimum grants this attack a +1 bonus against you.

#### Hencor's Press

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 yards

**Effect**: You bring down a mysterious force against a foe. This inflicts a crushing attack against the target. If the attack damages the armor or is a critical hit, it knocks them prone.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum sees the attack gain a +1 bonus.

**Critical Failure**: You find the force attempts to befall you instead. You are knocked prone for a 1d4 + **x** rounds. Where **x** is the tier of the spell.

### Jinora (1
A diviner of astrological events. Their work is an important study for anyone seeking to provide prophetic capacities to their institution.

#### Jinora's Meteor

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 20 actions

**Range**: 100 yards

**Effect**: You call down a meteor, known as Jinora's Meteor, from the heavens above. It will not reach the target for a number of rounds equal to double the spell's tier. So long as the target remains in range, the meteor's trajectory will adjust to ensure it is directed properly. It is a Force attack and then a Fire attack against the foe. After the attacks resolve, the meteor disappears in an explosion of flame engulfing everything within 10 yards (including the target) in flame, inflicting a fire attack against it.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the range is doubled and you grant either the Force attack or initial Fire attack a +1 bonus.

**Critical Failure**: The meteor instead targets you. You swear you can see a panicked smile in the flames.

### Kostas (1
An alchemist and a master of conjury. His influence can be seen in many an chemister's treatise.

#### Kostas' Caustic Cast

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time:** 2 actions

**Effect**: You violently thrust your hands out as though you were splashing hot liquid away from you. This directs a wave of acid to attack everything in a 3 yard cone in front of you.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum provides a +1 bonus to each attack made by the spell.

**Critical Failures**: A critical failure sees the caster accidentally attack themselves with acid (including all bonuses they would have had) as they fail to propel it properly. This attack has advantage.

### Liston (1
A scoundrel who isn't even considered any form of arcanist. He is a thief and a reckless one at that.

#### Liston's Pry

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3+X actions

**Range**: 1 yard

**Effect**: You open or close a portal (a door, window, container, etc) of a non-magical nature. You may lock/unlock any number of non-magical locks or barres (or other lock which can run the entiry of one of the portal's dimensions) attached to the portal, but each barre requires an additional action to undo. These extra actions are not a part of the actual casting, but are done before the portal in question is opened of course. This spell does not set off magical alarms of a lower tier than this spell.

Where X is the tier of this spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: The spell can undo a magical lock of a spell whose tier is less than half of this spell's.

**Critical Failure**: You have jammed the portal in such a way that it cannot function as you intended when casting the spell (opening or closing). If you sought to undo any locks or barres, they are instead fixed shut by the spell and vice versa. This last for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure times the spell's tier. Additionally, you have set off any magical alarms set to the portal. To make things worse, you seem to be effected as though an identical alarm (or alarms) had been set to you. Have fun getting out of trouble.

### Vehemente (1
Arguauably the most intelligent arcanist of his world, he claims to hail from a world opporessed by warring forces of light.

#### Vehemente's Explosive Orbs

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 2 actions

**Effect**: You animate a number of ball bearings, marbles, or bullets, which have been coated in grease. You may animate a number up to the spell's tier so long as they fit in your hand. The spheres can levitate and move up to a number of yards equal to 5 + [Magic] bonus.

The spheres must remain within 15 yards of you or they become inert. As an action or reaction you may direct the orbs to move. When an orb comes in contact with a creature, you may have it inflict a force or fire attack. On a critical hit, it is treated as a fire attack regardless. In place of damaging armor, you may choose to have the orb explode. If you do, the attack gains a bonus for the purpose of inlicting a critical hit equal to the spell's tier. The orb is then destroyed.

Alternatively, the caster may use the bullet of a firearm with the gunpowder included as a component. Such a orb can be used to inflict an attack of the appropriate firearm when it comes in contact with a foe. When used this way, it is destroyed.

**At Higher Tiers**: In addition to the above benefits, the range the orbs may distance themselves from you is increased by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: The orbs each explode in your hand, as though you directed them each towards yourself and caused them to explode.
