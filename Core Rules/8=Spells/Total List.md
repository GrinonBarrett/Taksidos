### A (8

#### Abatis

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You cause a number of trees or rocks within range to fall in such a way as to provide barriers that feature protrusions up to 2 feet in front of you, with the barrier itself being dependant upon the materials. Any large or larger creature, or medium or larger mount, moving into contact with the barrier is subject to a piercing attack and must succeed either a [Body] or [Rflx] save (their choice) or be stopped. If a [Body] save is failed this way, treat the creature as impacting against the barrier, receiving knockback damage as though the remainder of the distance it was traveling was the knockback distance. If a [Rflx] save is failed this way, the creature is knocked prone.  
This barrier lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell check's points of success multiplied by the spell's tier.

If the caster is larger or smaller than Medium, adjust the size of the barrier accordingly.

The DV of the save is equal to double the spell's tier + the number of size classes above diminutive of the caster + the spell-check's points of success.

**At Higher Tiers**: As seen above, a higher tier provides several benefits.

**Critical Failure**: The barriers falls on you, inflict a Force attack, Crushing attack, and Piercing attack- each with a bonus equal to the spell's tier. The barrier is created, of course, and lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1d12 + spell tier.

#### Abaxiate

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 3 yards

**Duration**: 3 rounds

**Effect**: You hold this spell for its duration, during which you may use your reaction in response to an object or creature moving (before knowing what direction it plans to move in) to designate a new direction for it to move. If it is not phsyically possible for it to move in that direction with its chosen mode of movement, the movement is treated as knockback movement.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the range by 1 yard and duration by 1 round.

**Critical Failure**: You instead affect yourself with the spell. If you had already targeted yourself, you instead fail to move.

#### Abnegate

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You attempt to counter a spell being cast, as though you knew the spell, so long as it half the tier or lower than this spell. You must still perform a counterspell check. The foe gains a bonus to their check equal to their spell's tier and you gain a bonus equal to this spell's tier.
If you critcally fail your counterspell check, you cannot affect the spell with another abnegation of the same or lower tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: As seen above, a higher tier provides several benefits.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to counter the spell and infact have strengthened the caster against further counterspells equal to the difference in tier of this spell and their own.

#### Absend

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You cause an object to return to the relative position it occupied up to a number of minutes ago equal to the tier of the spell. A creature can be targeted by this spell, but is instead returned a point occupied measured in rounds not minutes. A creature affected by this must make a [Rflx] save or become prone or vulnerable (their choice, if they are already affected by one, they must choose the other). You may choose to grant that creature a bonus to its save equal to your [Magic] bonus.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier above minimum increases the range by 1 yard and the casting time by 1 action.

#### Alarum

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 5 minutes or more

**Range**: 60 yards

**Effect**: You magically mark a set point, up to 1 square foot, or a single portal (such as a door, window, or the opening of a container) you touch to produce stimuli of one of the five basic senses which can be perceived by anything within range. In the case of a specific point, it is disturbed if something comes in contact with it. In the case of a portal, it is disturbed if opened or closed.

So long as a creature has use of the selected sense and there is no obstruction to the stimuli, any creature within the tange will detect the stimuli.

This spell lasts a number of hours equal to the points of success (minimum of 1) multiplied by the total number of minutes spent casting the spell.

Once the alarum has been triggered, you may return it to its passive state as an action by taking on a point of spell-sickness. Another caster may try to do so as an action by performing a Spellcraft chrck with a DV equal to quadruple the spell's tier + your [Magic] bonus. The time spent "activated" still counts against the lifespan of the alarum.

**At Higher Tiers**: If cast as second tier or beyond, may produce stimuli of mulitple basic senses up to the tier of the spell, but the range is divided by the total number of senses for which stimuli is produced. Each tier beyond 1st also increases the range of the spell by 10 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You seem to have set the alarum just fine. The alarum is just as likely to randomly trigger as it is not to trigger when disturbed at all.

#### Animation

**Range**: 15 yards

**Effect**: You invoke a bolt of lightning to strike a foe within range. If the attack would damage the foe's armor or be a critical hit, it arcs to hit the nearest creature. Its range for this is half of the spell's range. It can arc again this way, but cannot strike the same creature multiple times. Each arcing halves the range.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the range is increased by 15 yards.

Additionally, you may only target a playable species (at narrator's discretion) or a creature of the same creature type as yourself with this spell.

The target is knocked back directly, anything else may choose to be knocked back away from you or away from the path of the lightning. During consecutive phases, in place of moving or performing an action, you may launch a follow-up bolt against the same target as part of this spell's effect. You may do this until one of the following occurs:  
• The target leaves the range of the spell.  
• The spell's attack fails to hit.  
• You perform a reaction.  
• You move.  
• The total number of phases exceeds the tier of the spell.

If an attack is a critical failure, the spell inflicts an electrical attack against you.

The fog may move slowly, with a number of square feet receeding up to the tier + spellcheck's points of success, with it spreading out elsewhere an equal number of square feet. This movement requires the caster maintain concentration on it. The fog does not need to conform to a standard shape, so long as it is contiguous.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the square footage by 50 and the range by [Magic] yards.

#### Ironside

**Minimum Tier**: 2

 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh.   
 • Do not benefit from armor. They are treated as wearing plate.  
 • They do not receive damage from being crushed (including crushing attacks), falling, or knockback- but instead become dazed and prone for a number of rounds equal to the attack(s) total.  
 • Cutting, Piercing, Radiant, Necrotic and Toxic attacks against the affected creature have disadvantage.  
 • Acid attacks against the affected creature have advantage.  
 • Non-magical weapon attacks have disadvantage against the creature, as do typical unarmed attacks.

Once these decisions are made, they can't be changed.

After the spell ends, for a number of hours equal to the total minutes of duration, the affeted creature has a -1 penalty to all [Body] and [Fort] checks/saves and a -1 penalty to all attacks.

A creature may make a [Fort] save to avoid this if they wish.

So long as the target remains in range, the meteor's trajectory will adjust to ensure it is directed properly. It is a Force attack and then a Fire attack against the foe. After the attacks resolve, the meteor disappears in an explosion of flame engulfing everything within 10 yards (including the target) in flame, inflicting a fire attack against it.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the range is doubled and you grant either the Force attack or initial Fire attack a +1 bonus.

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 yards

**Effect**: You create a molten shape, vaguely resembling a throwing axe, which is then hurled at a foe. This inflicts a fire attack against the target.

You may lock/unlock any number of non-magical locks or barres (or other lock which can run the entiry of one of the portal's dimensions) attached to the portal, but each barre requires an additional action to undo. These extra actions are not a part of the actual casting, but are done before the portal in question is opened of course. This spell does not set off magical alarms of a lower tier than this spell.

Where X is the tier of this spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: The spell can undo a magical lock of a spell whose tier is less than half of this spell's.

**Critical Failure**: You have jammed the portal in such a way that it cannot function as you intended when casting the spell (opening or closing). If you sought to undo any locks or barres, they are instead fixed shut by the spell and vice versa. This last for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure times the spell's tier. Additionally, you have set off any magical alarms set to the portal. To make things worse, you seem to be effected as though an identical alarm (or alarms) had been set to you.

 • Cannot wear armor. Any flammable armor they are wearing is burnt up. They are treated as wearing brigandine.  
 • They do not receive damage from being crushed (including crushing attacks), falling, or knockback- but instead become dazed and prone for a number of rounds equal to the attack(s) total.  
 • Cold attacks against them have disadvantage and cause them to be prone for a number of rounds equal to the attack total. This is cumulative.  
 • Critical hits of Cold and Crushing attacks leave the subject vulnerable until the end of the round, even if the subject would not be wounded by it.  
 • Every round the subject spends at least half submerged in water reduces its move speeds by 1 foot until it spend twice as much time dry. This is cumulative. Once the subject's last mode of movement is reduced to 0 this way, it loses the ability to move at all until the appropriate amount of time has been spent dry.  
 • The subject puts off light like a torch.  
 • Any effect which would heal the subject has a 1 in 4 chance not to.  
 • They do not swim in water, instead walking on the surface below.

A creature may make a [Fort] save to avoid this if they wish.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may affect an additional creature and the range is increased to a number of yards equal to the spell's tier.
