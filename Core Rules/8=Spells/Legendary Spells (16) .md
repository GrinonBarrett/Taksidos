Legendary spells are named for their creator. These spells are listed by creator rather than letter. Legendary spells cannot simply be learned by a character. The creators' notes are often lost or buried and require deciphering. Alternatively, if such a magician is still alive, direct tutalege could allow a character to learn such a spell.

### Alekard (2
A blood sucking priest from another world which gained divinity. His original name was corrupted into its current form in the process.

#### Alekard's Blood Barrage

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 25 yards

**Effect**: You inflict a necrotic attack against a foe within range, opening up some form of wound in their flesh if successful. In place of damaging armor, this attack inflicts hemorrhaging. Instead of rolling for the wound's effect, it lowers the maximum hitpoints of the creature by 1 until it is healed. If the foe is hemorrhaging (either as a result of this spell or a preexisting condition), you manipulate some of their blood and transmute it into up to 3 projectiles which may be hurled at a different target within a number of yards equal to the tier of this spell to inflict a club attack. Each of these attacks, if a critical hit, can be treated as one of the following attack types (acid, cold, fire, necrotic).

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum can grant one of the club attacks attack a +1 bonus or increase the number of club attacks by 1, in addition to the benefits noted above.

**Critical Failure**: You seem to cast the spell, but afflict yourself instead. You may still direct the club attacks as normal.

#### Alekard's Radiant Smite

**Minimum Tier**: 4

**Casting Time**: 2 rounds

**Range**: 25 yards

**Effect**: You produce a threatening orb of light directed in a straight line to a point you designate within range. Upon impact, whatever it impacts with is subject to a necrotic attack and the sphere explodes, causing anything within 3 yards (including what it impacted with) to be subject to a radiant attack. If the intial (necrotic) attack is a critical hit, you may inflict a level of exhasution against the foe. If they receive exhaustion this way, you recover a level of exhaustion.

On a critical success, you may alter the damage type of the initial attack to be radiant or fire.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum can grant the initial attack a +1 bonus or increase the explosion radius by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: You have offended Alekard in some way. You are subject to a necrotic attack, fire attack, and radiant attack. For each of these attacks, you may choose to take on a level of fatigue to ignore the attack before it is rolled.

#### Hencor's Needles

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a stream of needles directed at a foe within range, inflicting a piercing attack against them. On a critical hit, some of the needles will bounce off of the target, allowing you to direct them to inflict an attack against another foe within 1 yard of the original.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you produce an additional original attack. A creature may only be hit by a single original attack and a single bounced attack by this spell.

**Critical Failure**: Your conjured needles do not actually attack the foe, instead bouncing off of them harmlessly and inflicting a piercing attack against you. Each tier beyond minimum grants this attack a +1 bonus against you.

#### Hencor's Press

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Duration**: Minutes equal to the spell check's points of success

**Effect**: You produce a protective field around yoursef. Your minimum defense against attacks is now equal to 3 + double the tier of this spell. If you have armor or another protective feature which would provide a higher defense against an attack than this, use that value instead.

**At higher tiers**: As noted above, increases the minimum defense provided.

**Critical Failure**: You have imprisoned yourself for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. This leaves you completely Immobile for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. You still benefit from the spell's protection during this time.

After the attacks resolve, the meteor disappears in an explosion of flame engulfing everything within 10 yards (including the target) in flame, inflicting a fire attack against it.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the range is doubled and you grant either the Force attack or initial Fire attack a +1 bonus.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum provides a +1 bonus to each attack made by the spell.

**Critical Failures**: A critical failure sees the caster accidentally attack themselves with acid (including all bonuses they would have had) as they fail to propel it properly. This attack has advantage.

#### Kostas' Insulating Spray

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 4 Actions

**Effect**: You project a strange faming fluid in a 3 yard cone by flicking out your hands, touching together. Anything within the cone is covered in an insulating material for an hour.

Furthermore, a creature affected by this spells suffers a penalty to all [Rflx] checks and saves equal to half of the spell's tier (minimum of -1). The coating can be negated by an acid attack with a value of 13 or greater. Time spent in soapy water dissolves the foam twice as quick.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum allows you to extend the range of the spell's cone by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: You stick together your two limbs used (or one if cast with a single limb) in a concentrated and hardened form of the foam, binding them together until it breaks apart.

### Liston (3
A scoundrel who isn't even considered any form of arcanist. He is a thief and a reckless one at that.

**Range**: 12 yards

**Effect**: You propel a number of thrown blades from your grasp towards different targets within range equal to 2 + spell tier. These are standard thrown attacks.

**At Higher Tiers**: In additon to the benefit above, each tier above minimum can provide one of the following benefits; range is increased by 4 yards, one of the attacks gains a +1 bonus, you propel an additional thrown blade.

**Critical Failure**: You manage to send each of the blades in various directions such that no one is harmed. In the process of attempting to dodge them however, you are made prone and vulnerable until the end of the next round.

#### Liston's Pry

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3+X actions

**Range**: 1 yard

**Effect**: You open or close a portal (a door, window, container, etc) of a non-magical nature. You may lock/unlock any number of non-magical locks or barres (or other lock which can run the entiry of one of the portal's dimensions) attached to the portal, but each barre requires an additional action to undo. These extra actions are not a part of the actual casting, but are done before the portal in question is opened of course. This spell does not set off magical alarms of a lower tier than this spell.

Where X is the tier of this spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: The spell can undo a magical lock of a spell whose tier is less than half of this spell's.

**Critical Failure**: You have jammed the portal in such a way that it cannot function as you intended when casting the spell (opening or closing). If you sought to undo any locks or barres, they are instead fixed shut by the spell and vice versa. This last for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure times the spell's tier. Additionally, you have set off any magical alarms set to the portal. To make things worse, you seem to be effected as though an identical alarm (or alarms) had been set to you. Have fun getting out of trouble.

### Tinto (2
An ancient magi who managed to illustrate uses of magic in ageiculture, medicine, and war.

#### Tinto's Circle

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You cast a circle of flames around a target, which stretches out between 1 and 5 yards of it.

Anything entering or exiting the area of the spell is subject to a fire attack. A creature attempting to exit the circle must succeed a [Will] save or find itself unable to actually leave the circle. The DV is is double the spell's tier + your [Magic] bonus.

You may use your reaction to inflict a crushing attack against a creature within the area of the spell. 

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the range by 1 yard and increases the duration by 1 minute.

**Critical Failure**: You cast the circle around yourself. You find it impossible to even attempt to leave. At the end of each phase, it shrinks by 1 foot, keeping itself centered on you. Once it finally shrinks to the point that it must collapse in on you, it inflicts a number of fire attacks against you equal to the tier of the spell. An immunity to the harm of fire does not protect you from this, but instead has the attacks made with disadvantage.

#### Tinto's Healing

**Minimum Tier**: 6

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 1 yard

**Effect**: A creature of your choice within range performs an incapacitation save. If the check is succesful, you heal a wound of your choice or an instance of hemorhaging (your choice as caster) from the creature. If it is a critical success, it also recovers a hitpoint.
Failure on the save does not harm the creature in anyway, but a critical failure prevents the creature from having its hitpoints or wounds restored by spells from the same caster of an equal or lower tier in the same day.

**At Higher Tiers**: For every tier beyond minimum, the save is made with a +1 bonus.

**Critical Failure**: You must perform an incapacitation save with a penalty equal to the spell's tier. A critical failure will not kill you, but you will instead receive spell sickness equal to the points of failure.

#### Vehemente's Explosive Orbs

The spheres must remain within 15 yards of you or they become inert. As an action or reaction you may direct the orbs to move. When an orb comes in contact with a creature, you may have it inflict a force or fire attack. On a critical hit, it is treated as a fire attack regardless. In place of damaging armor, you may choose to have the orb explode. If you do, the attack gains a bonus for the purpose of inlicting a critical hit equal to the spell's tier. The orb is then destroyed.

Alternatively, the caster may use the bullet of a firearm with the gunpowder included as a component. Such a orb can be used to inflict an attack of the appropriate firearm when it comes in contact with a foe. When used this way, it is destroyed.

**At Higher Tiers**: In addition to the above benefits, the range the orbs may distance themselves from you is increased by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: The orbs each explode in your hand, as though you directed them each towards yourself and caused them to explode. 

#### Vehemente's Great Icosohedron

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 4 rounds

**Range**: 50 yards

**Effect**: You smash together magical particles to produce a great icosohedron small enough to fit in your hand, which can then be directed in a straight line to a point you designate within range. Upon impact, it explodes causing anything within 5 yards to be subject to the explosion. The explosion will inflict a force attack. For a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier, as long as you concentrate on the spell, you may choose to use your reaction to cause an identical explosion in the same point as the original. You may only do so once.

When the spell explodes, you may choose to inflict knockback (in feet) up to the spell's points of success + your [Magic] bonus. This is divded by the weight in stones of anything affected.

On a critical success, you may have the shape of the explosion change to become a cone with a length equal to the spell's typical radius. It is pointed in a direction of your choice.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond its minimum can grant the secondary explosion a +1 bonus to the attack or increase the explosion radius (or cone length) by 1 yard.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to form a stable shape with the spell, causing it to explode with you at the center, which can inflict knockback (you are knocked backwards). Additionally, for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier, you are subject to residual particuls- inflicting a force attack with disadvantage against you at the end of each such round.

### Zorne (1

Upon impact, the sphere explodes causing anything within 4 yards to be subject to the explosion. The explosion will inflict a lightning attack aginst whatever it impacted with and the resulting explosion will inflict an electrical attack against anything within the blast.
