Basic spells are those that a newer player could be exposed to knowing. Anytime a class or species' feature allows a character to gain a spell, it should be selected from this list.

### A (9

#### Abatis

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You cause a number of trees or rocks within range to fall in such a way as to provide barriers that feature protrusions up to 2 feet in front of you, with the barrier itself being dependant upon the materials. Any large or larger creature, or medium or larger mount, moving into contact with the barrier is subject to a piercing attack and must succeed either a [Body] or [Rflx] save (their choice) or be stopped. If a [Body] save is failed this way, treat the creature as impacting against the barrier, receiving knockback damage as though the remainder of the distance it was traveling was the knockback distance. If a [Rflx] save is failed this way, the creature is knocked prone.  
This barrier lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell check's points of success multiplied by the spell's tier.

If the caster is larger or smaller than Medium, adjust the size of the barrier accordingly.

The DV of the save is equal to double the spell's tier + the number of size classes above diminutive of the caster + the spell-check's points of success.

**At Higher Tiers**: As seen above, a higher tier provides several benefits.

**Critical Failure**: The barriers fall on you, inflicting a Force attack, Crushing attack, and Piercing attack- each with a bonus equal to the spell's tier. The barrier is created, of course, and lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1d12 + spell tier.

#### Abaxiate

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 3 yards

**Duration**: 3 rounds

**Effect**: You hold this spell for its duration, during which you may use your reaction in response to an object or creature moving (before knowing what direction it plans to move in) to designate a new direction for it to move. If it is not phsyically possible for it to move in that direction with its chosen mode of movement, the movement is treated as knockback movement.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the range by 1 yard and duration by 1 round.

**Critical Failure**: You instead affect yourself with the spell. If you had already targeted yourself, you instead fail to move.

#### Abnegate

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 20 yards

**Effect**: You attempt to counter a spell being cast, as though you knew the spell, so long as it half the tier or lower than this spell. You must still perform a counterspell check. The foe gains a bonus to their check equal to their spell's tier and you gain a bonus equal to this spell's tier.
If you critcally fail your counterspell check, you cannot affect the spell with another abnegation of the same or lower tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: As seen above, a higher tier provides several benefits.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to counter the spell and infact have strengthened the caster against further counterspells equal to the difference in tier of this spell and their own.

#### Absend

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 4 actions

**Range**: 5 yards

**Effect**: You cause an object to return to the relative position it occupied up to a number of minutes ago equal to the tier of the spell. A creature can be targeted by this spell, but is instead returned a point occupied measured in rounds not minutes. A creature affected by this must make a [Rflx] save or become prone or vulnerable (their choice, if they are already affected by one, they must choose the other). You may choose to grant that creature a bonus to its save equal to your [Magic] bonus.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier above minimum increases the range by 1 yard and the casting time by 1 action.

**Critical Failure**: You accidentally are affected by this spell instead. Additionally, as a result of the spell, you must succeed a [Fort] save or be Obtunded for a number of rounds equal to the tier of the spell.

#### Absenting

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take in response to moving

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You instantly disappear. After 1d12 rounds, you move to a point in range of your choosing.

**Critical Failure**: You appear in the opposite direction intended and are prone.

#### Alarum

**Minimum Tier**: 1

**Casting Time**: 5 minutes or more

**Range**: 60 yards

**Effect**: You magically mark a set point, up to 1 square foot, or a single portal (such as a door, window, or the opening of a container) you touch to produce stimuli of one of the five basic senses which can be perceived by anything within range. In the case of a specific point, it is disturbed if something comes in contact with it. In the case of a portal, it is disturbed if opened or closed.

So long as a creature has use of the selected sense and there is no obstruction to the stimuli, any creature within the tange will detect the stimuli.

This spell lasts a number of hours equal to the points of success (minimum of 1) multiplied by the total number of minutes spent casting the spell.

Once the alarum has been triggered, you may return it to its passive state as an action by taking on a point of spell-sickness. Another caster may try to do so as an action by performing a Spellcraft chrck with a DV equal to quadruple the spell's tier + your [Magic] bonus. The time spent "activated" still counts against the lifespan of the alarum.

**At Higher Tiers**: If cast as second tier or beyond, may produce stimuli of mulitple basic senses up to the tier of the spell, but the range is divided by the total number of senses for which stimuli is produced. Each tier beyond 1st also increases the range of the spell by 10 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You seem to have set the alarum just fine. The alarum is just as likely to randomly trigger as it is not to trigger when disturbed at all.

#### Aldervalder

**Minimum Tier**: 3

**Casting Time**: 5 actions

**Range**: 10 yards

**Effect**: You conjure a spirit of nature to strike a foe within range, treat as a biting attack. The spirit ceases to be after a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier +1 and can be redirected against a new foe as areaction. If no new target is chosen, it will inflict a bite against the same foe at the end of the secondary action phase.

As a reaction, it can be directed at a creature which is missing hitpoints. It must succeed an incapacitation save. If successful to any degree, the creature recovers a hitpoint. A failure yields no negative consequences. The spirt ceases to exist upon such an attempt. It may only recover a hitpoint lost while the spirit existed.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, in addition to the benefits noted above, the range is increased by 2 yards.

**Critical Failure**: The spirit conjured is quite upset with you. It grapples you for a number of rounds equal to the spell's tier. You cannot fight against this. During the primary action phase while you are grappled, it inflicts a biting attack against you. You are prone during this time.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the casting time is increased. It will be a number of actions equal to the tier squared. At certain tiers it can create a creature as a result of its usage. This is not recommended for anyone to do.

**Critical Failure**: If you cast it in its traditional manner, you create a comical moment from your ineptitude. If you used this spell to create a creature, things will be much worse.

#### Arc Lightning

**Minimum Tier**: 2

**Casting Time**: 3 actions

**Range**: 15 yards

**Effect**: You invoke a bolt of lightning to strike a foe within range. If the attack would damage the foe's armor or be a critical hit, it arcs to hit the nearest creature.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, the range is increased by 15 yards.

**Critical Failure**: You fail to ground yourself properly. The spell functions as normal, but attacks you as the original target.

**Range**: 1 foot + a number of feet equal to the spellcheck's points of success.

Whatever is suggested cannot be something whose effect would be greater than a number of hours equal to the spell's tier. This cannot be something that would cause great harm or violate one's moral tenets. Additionally, you may only target a playable species (at narrator's discretion) or a creature of the same creature type as yourself with this spell. You cannot target a creature of undeath unless you are also a creature of undeath.

**Effect**: You conjure a bolt of lightning against a target within range. It, and everything in a straight line to it, are subject to an electrical attack.

The target is knocked back directly, anything else may choose to be knocked back away from you or away from the path of the lightning. During consecutive phases, in place of moving or performing an action, you may launch a follow-up bolt against the same target as part of this spell's effect. You may do this until one of the following occurs:  
• The target leaves the range of the spell.  
• The spell's attack fails to hit.  
• You perform a reaction.  
• You move.  
• The total number of phases exceeds the tier of the spell.

**At Higher Tiers**: For each tier beyond minimum, you may produce this water up to 1 foot away.

**Casting Time**: 100 Rounds

**Range**: (Spellcheck result) yards x10

**Effect**: A bank of fog begins to roll out from the point you designate, filling up to 100 square feet. Anytime the fog comes in contact with a creature, that creature is subject to a nercotic attack. Additionally, any creature which ends the round within the fog is subject to a necrotic attack. The fog may move slowly, with a number of square feet receeding up to the tier + spellcheck's points of success, with it spreading out elsewhere an equal number of square feet. This movement requires the caster maintain concentration on it. The fog does not need to conform to a standard shape, so long as it is contiguous. At the end of each round, after it has inflicted attacks, it will lose a number of square feet equal to its tier.

**At Higher Tiers**: Each tier beyond minimum increases the square footage by 50 and the range by [Magic] yards.

During the same phase of the following round, if a creature had their hitpoint recovery prevented this way, it must make an incapacitation save.

A magical effect which would heal a wound appears to heal the wound, until the same phase of the following round.

If a creature performs an incapacitation save and the die result is odd, it loses 1 hitpoint if it has any.

Effects that restore points of undeath from within the field or affecting a target within the field have the total points recovered halved (round down).

At the end of the phase, you may decide to continue performing the same recitation to continue the effect. This requires a spellcheck as normal, but suffers a -1 cumulative penalty for each phase you have continued this. This consumes the whole of your activity for the phase and you cannot take reactions while doing so. The attack and save occur again during each phase this is continued. Additionally, the range of the spell is increased by 1 yard after each phase.

While constricting a foe, treat as a graplle with the following exception. Your value is equal to the spell check result + spell tier. The grappled target cannot use [Rflx].

It is up to .5 foot wide and equally tall. This beam lasts for a number of phases equal to the number of phases the sphere had been concentrated on. Anything in the area suffers a radiant attack. While the beam is active, it and the sphere it emits from produce bright light up to 1 yard, fair light 4 yards beyond that, and dim light 1 yard beyond that.

An object does not add a [Body] score it does not have. If you throw it into yourself, you may make a [Rflx] save (with a DV equal to the DV of this spell's spell check) to have it safely sent to your grasp. A critical failure's effects are determined by the narrator.

• Jump distances are halved.  
• Climb and fly speeds are halved.  
• When the effect occurs, and anytime a creature's movement is performed through the sphere, a creature must succeed a [Body] save or be knocked prone as it gets pulled to the ground.

* Electric: Instead of potentially damaging armo, the attack arcs, inflicting an electric attack against the nearst creature within a number of yards equal to the spell's tier- even if it is not illuminated. A creature struck by any attack from this sentinel, including an arced attack, cannot be struck by an arced attack in the same phase.
