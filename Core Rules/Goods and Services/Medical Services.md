#### MEDICAL SERVICES

Health is the most important thing for a character.  A character may pay for medical care or be lucky enough to be cared for by Hospitaloi (an order of free lancing practitioners of medicine).

A stay at a competent medicarum, or hospital, generally costs $80 per day. This covers appropriate foods, and medicines. This ensures the character gains a full rest for each day they spend, excluding their first day (which still gains a long rest), while also receiving the benefits of recovering 1 hitpoint per day and gaining a +1d6 bonus to any saves made against disease, poison, and any other medical conditions.

If the character is lucky enough to have fallen into the hands of Hospitaloi, they can see their fee waived by making a reasonable donation or agreeing to take on a quest.

If the character is completely unpleasant they may be charged the appropriate cost of their stay, between $100-$350 per day.
