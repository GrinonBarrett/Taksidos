### TRADE GOODS
Money is not universal. Though you will find currency which is accepted outside of its home nation, often times it is better to have raw goods available- it is the oldest form of wealth after all. Prices fluctuate with goods, but the average value is listed below. In hard times, a good may be worth up to 20% more. In a market with less demand, you might see a discount of up to 20%. Unlike most items a player sells, which would see them receiving only half of the listed value for sale, trade goods are sold at market value. A savvy merchant will try to get a percentage discount of a d12 result however.
