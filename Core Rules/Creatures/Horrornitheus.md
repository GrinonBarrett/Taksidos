#### Special Features

**Drill Peck**: If the horrornitheus has moved at least 30 yards since the beginning of the last phase and has not attacked since then, it may treat its beak attack as a couched lance.

**Ornithoptery**: So long as the Horrornitheus is not prone, its weight load limits are increased by half. If it is using its hover speed, it is instead doubled.
