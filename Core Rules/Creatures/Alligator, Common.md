**Strong Jaw**: The alligator's jaw has evolved for snatching prey fatally. When performing a bite attack, it gains a bonus for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit equal to its [Body] bonus. Additionally, if the attack roll is succesful and an even number or would qualify to damage armor, and the foe is no more than 1 size category larger than itself- the foe is grappled. If the alligator's bite attack qualified to damage armor and the foe has no armor, it also inflicts a crushing attack.

**Difficulty Opening**: The alligator's jaw is evolved in such a way that its jaw cannot open if held shut by a competently strong individual. Any creature brawling with the alligator may forgoe its reaction for the round to hold the jaw shut so long as the combination of its [Body] score and [Body] bonus is greater than the alligator's [Body] score.

**Swallow Whole**: If it successfully bites a creature of at least two size categories smaller, it may swallow it whole as an action. A creature may be able to cut its way out or succeed an opposed [Rflx] check with disadvantage using their Wrestling skill to escape.

**Mellowed Pace**:  The alligator suffers exhaustion anytime it sprints.

**Surprisingly Sprightly**: If the alligator is sprinting and did not sprint during the previous round, its run speed is tripled. As an additional option for a critical success while brawling, it can inflict a bite attack against that foe (this still suffers the penalty for attacking while brawling).
