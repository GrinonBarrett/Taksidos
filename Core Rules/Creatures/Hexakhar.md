**Fiendish Nature**: The hexakhar's fiendish nature bestows it with a few particular features;  
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • Are not subject to bleeding.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom.  
 • Gains a bonus to all saves equal to current hitpoints.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect the flesh.   
 
**Odd Anatomy**: The hexakhar can move with no prefence as to orientation, effectively treating itself as having no discernable top or bottom and may hover in any direct it can see. So long as it can see a threat, it is never considered to be attacked from behind or flanked. If it cannot see a threat, it is as being attacked from behind.

**Limited Senses**: The fauxakhar has no sense of smell or taste. It cannot receive stimuli from scents or tastes in any capacity as a result (including illusory effects). Each of its senses reach into the ethereal plane while on the material plane (and vice versa). Its senses can also tell if it is perceiving something magical.

**Great View**: The hexakhar's eyes each provide a full hemispherical view.

**Sweet Sound**: As an action, the hexakhar can produce a sound that is apealing to beasts, humanoids, and sylvan creatures. Each such creature within 100 yards which can hear must succeed an [Inte] save with a DV of 13 or investigate the sound. A critcal failure will daze the creature for a number of phases equal to the points of failure. A success results in the sound being dismissed. A critical success results in the listener recognizing it as some very unnatural sound and knowing the direction it came from. It must rest before using this feature again.  
A hexakhar is immune to the effect of another hexakhar's or a zezykhar's Sweet Sound feature.

**Scrambled Wave**: As an action, it produces a variety of frequencies which are harmful to the function of many processes. Any creature within 25 yards which can hear it is subject to a sonic attack. It must rest before doing so again.

**Basic Eye Beams**: As an action or reaction, two of its eyes may fire a ray like that of a wand at a foe it perceivesthe same or different targets. This is a ki attack. Each eye may only perform one such attack each round. These beams suffer no penalty to attacks for brawling. If two eyes are focused on a single target this way, treat as a single attack with a +2 bonus.

**Alternative Eye Beams**: Once per round, *the hexakhar may alter the damage type of one of its eye beams to be fire, cold, electric, necrotic, psychic, sonic, or toxic*. Alternatively, it may have an eyebem treated as an undamaging attack. If succesful, *a creature so affected becomes vulnerable until the end of the round. A critical success makes it instead vulnerable until the end of the next round*. When using this feature, it cannot fire a pair of basic eye beams at the same target.

**Piercing Stare**: As an action, the hexakhar fires a basic eyebeam from each of its eyes at the same time at a single target. *It may treat any of the beams as piercing attacks for this purpose. If the attack is a critical hit, regardless of whether its attack type was changed, it inflicts the critical hit effect of the original damage type and a piercing attack*. It must rest before doing so again.

**False beams**: As an action, it fires a beam of illusory power from each eye at a different target. *A creature so targeted must succeed a [Will] or [Prcp] save. If it fails, its hitpoints are reduced by 1. If it is a critical failure, it becomes prone and vulnerable until the end of the round*. It cannot do so during consecutive rounds. A critical success on the save reveals the nature of the attack to the creature, and it ceases to be affected by it for the rest of the encounter. A creature with no hitpoints remaining suffers no effect from this.

**Infernal Regeneration**: At the end of any round the hexakhar receives a wound and has any hitpoints remaining, it may use its reaction to roll a d12 and compare it to its current hitpoints. If the result is lower, it recovers a single hitpoint. It must perform a rest before doing so again.

**Triplicate**: As an action, *the hexakhar creatures two illusory entities that appear exactly it does. They spawn within 6 yards. These entities have no hitpoints, retain the fauxakhar's hover speed, have the Fauxakhar's False Beams feature, have no senses, and cannot physically interact with anything. Any attack roll of 9 or greater will destroy it, as will anything requireing it to make a save*. They cannot act independently, instead receiving psychic commands from their originating hexakhar- which demands its concentration to maintain.

**Sextuple Beam**: As an action, the hexakhar fires a basic eyebeam from each of its eyes at the same time. It must rest before doing so again.

**Spinning Trick**: When it would move, if it is not restrained or immobile, *it may use its reaction to instead fire beams from each of its eyes and spin rapidly- inflicting an two attacks in all 360 degrees. The is a ki attack and a necrotic attack. It must rest before doing so again. The attacks get a -1 for each missing eye*.

**Concentrated Eye Beam Attack**: When it would use its basic eyebeams against a foe it can perceive with all six eyes, it may use its reaction to fire a beam from each at that foe with each eye. It chooses 6 different damage types from its Alternative Eye Beam. Once it has done so, it receives a level of fatigue and is vulnerable until the end of the next round. It must rest before doing so again.

**Triplipace**: *Its hover speed is tripled*.

**Weak**: The hexakhar's weight load limits are halved.
