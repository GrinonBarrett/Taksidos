**Fleet Foot**: During the first round of an encounter, the dog may use its action to perform a move.

**Built for Speed**: When sprinting, its run speed is multiplied by the number of sprints it has performed since the start of the previous round.

**Vicious Bite**: As an additional option when it succeeds a critical success while brawling, it may bite the foe whom it is brawling. This is treated as a Biting attack, ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling.

**Sharp Nose**: The dog gets a +2 bonus to [Prcp] checks and -2 penalty to [Prcp] saves elated to scent.

**Latching Bite**: If the dog's bite would qualify to damage armor, the foe is grappled.

**Charged ATtack**: When it attacks, if it moved the entirety of its run movement (either a typical mode of movement or sprint) since the beginning of the round- it may use its reaction to grant yourself a bonus to your attack equal to 1/4 the distance in yards it moved since the start of the round or its previous action (whichever is most recent). If it does, and the attack is a critical failure, it is vulnerable until the end of the round.
