**Breath Weapon**: Korsikhors are capable of exhaling a line of caustic mist, as an action. The line is 15 yards in length and is a foot high and wide. Anything caught within the line suffers an Acid attack. Once the korsikhor has used this ability, it cannot do so again until it rests.
Alternatively, it may cause the breath weapon to take the form of a cone. Doing so reduces the length to half of its usual length as it sweeps its head side to side.

**Roar**: The korsikhor looses a terrifying roar. All creatures within 15 yards must succeed a [Will] save with a DV of 11 or be frightened. A creature frightened this way must spend all of its movement points attempting to flee the korsikhor. All skill checks made by an affected creature have a -2 penalty. It may make a new save each round as an action to snap itself out of the fright, so long as it does not perceive the koriskhor.

**Magic Sense**: The korsikhor is capable of detecting any source of magic within 10 yards, or 5 if it is behind sufficient enclosure. Additionally, as an action, it may attempt to detect magic out a number of yards equal to double its [Prcp] score.
