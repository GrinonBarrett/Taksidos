**Startling Speed**: Once per encounter, as an action or reaction, the barmpasow may perform a movement.

**Stinger Venom**: Anything struck by the barmpasow's stinger is also subject to a toxic attack as a result of the venom. If the toxic attack is successful, the struck creature must also succed a [Fort] save with a DV equal to the attack's total or find themselves slightly parlyzed by the venom. They become prone and have their movement halved while affected by it. At the end of every round, they make a new [Fort] save with a DV of 20 minus the number of rounds they have been affected to shake off the effects.

**Color Pattern**: The barmpasow gets a +4 visually based bonus to its stealth in its home environment.
