#### Special Features 

**Amorphous**: Infectious puddings don’t retain a single cohesive shape but are instead in the form of a glob of gooey material. This confers some strange properties to it.  
 • Immunity to falling and knockback damage.  
 • Obstacles that would reduce the speed of it have only half of their normal effect unless they specifically affect amorphous creatures as well.  
 • All forms of non-magical attack against it have disadvantage.  
 • Anytime a spell would be cast against it that would affect its form, shape, composition, or mental state- it gains a d12 bonus to its saves against that effect.  
 • It cannot be grappled.  
 • While the it has a creature grappled, it can treat that creature as being unarmored for the purpose of attacking it.  
 • It is capable of traveling through any opening small enough to stick one’s fist.  
 • Cannot use armor, shields, or any item.   
 • Receives wounds, but no effect from them.

 **Infigural Nature**: Being infigura, infectious puddings have several advantages.  
 • Immunity to all poisons and diseases, including toxic damage, except those that specifically affect infigura.  
 • Immunity to the effects of bloodloss.  
 • Immunity to fatigue from outside sources.  
 • Immunity to sleep.  
 • Immunity to effects which cause asphyxiation.  
 • Immunity to effects which would inflict the prone condition, unless it specifically targets infigura.  
 • Does not require sleep to rest, but must still manage to relax and unwind as other creatures would.  
 • Immunity to incapacitation, but is destroyed when wounded with no remaining hitpoints.

**Minimal Sensing**: It is, in the most technical sense, blind. It is also devoid of the senses of smell and hearing. Instead it relies on sensing vibrations and its ability to taste everything it comes in contact with. Anytime it would attempt a check or save based on perceiving something, it has disadvantage (likewise, it should get advantage against illusions based on such stimuli). If it would rely on multiple missing senses, it suffers an additional -2 penalty for each total sense. If it is touching or tasting something, it does not have any issues identifying it.

**Mindless**: Infectious Puddings do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing effects and fear-based effects.
