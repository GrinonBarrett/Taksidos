**Fiendish Nature**: The wyndakhor's fiendish nature bestows it with a few particular features;  
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • Are not subject to bleeding.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom.  
 • Gains a bonus to all saves equal to current hitpoints.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect the flesh.  

**Woundless**: The wyndakhor does not receive the effects of wounds nor does it roll incapcitation saves when its hitpoints are reduced to 0. It is simply destroyed if damaged with no remaining hitpoints.

**Live to Kill**: The wyndakhor must sustain itself by killing others. It does not need to consume any part of it, merely the act of killing benefits it. Small game animals can continue its existence for a day. Game animals extend its lifespan by 1d4+1 days. Humanoids and similar creatures sustain it by 1d6+4 days. Other larger creatures grant it 1d8+2 days.  
It gains no such benfits of killing Constructs, Elementals, Ephemera, Eldritches, Fiends, and Undead

**Infernal Regeneration**: At the end of any round the wyndakhor loses any hitpoints and has any hitpoints remaining, it may use its reaction to roll a 12 and compare it to its current hitpoints. If the result is lower, it recovers a single hitpoint. It must perform a rest before doing so again.

**Wyndakhor Regeneration**: As an action, the wyndakhor may recover 1d4-1 hitpoints. It must complete a full rest before doing so again.

**Unearthly Appetite**: The wyndakhor is capable of consuming creatures other than Constructs, Elementals, Ephemera, Eldritches, Fiends, and Undead. This can take some time. Presume it can consume about 10 pounds per hour for every hour of the day. It will retain the weight of what it has consumed, but shed it at the rate of 1d4 pounds per hour.

**Attribute Changes**: The attributes of the wyndakhor is shaped by what it consumes. It loses a number of points in each attribute equal to its current bonus, but gains points equal to the consumed creature's bonus for each attribute appropriately.

**Shapeshifting**: The wyndakhor can transform into a creature it has fully consumed. This require a whole minute. It is vulnerable during this time. While in the form, it functions identically to a member of that creature's stat block. If a wyndakhor in an alternative form would fail an incapacitation save in any degree, it will begin changing into its natural form immediately, which will take a number of rounds equal to 20 minus its [Fort] score. It is vulnerable during this time. If the wyndakhor is made to revert to its natural form this way, it cannot shapeshift until it completes a full rest. If it is not engaged in battle, it can spend an entire minute vulnerable to return to its natural form without penalty.
