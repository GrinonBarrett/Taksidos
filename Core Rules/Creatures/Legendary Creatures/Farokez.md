### Farokez
A monstrous thing. It propels itself primarily with its powerful hind legs, like those of a kangaroo. Its front legs instead feature clawed paws. It has a long snout which hides its barb-like teeth. The tail ends in a set of manipulators which appear to function like a hand. Its fur is madded and crusted from dried blood and other types of grime. Embedded in its head is the releif of a long forgotten ruler pressed on an ancient copper coin, green and worn. It is intelligent enough to reason, but does not communicate. It seems to understand the concept of rulership and dominion over others and will attempt to intimidate creatures. It enjoys hoarding coinage and weapons, despite needing neither.

**Size**: The Farokez stands between 5-6 feet tall when standing, but can be as long as 9 feet while prowling. It weighs 200 pounds. It is a medium creature.

#### Special Features 

**Fiendish Nature**: The farokez's fiendish nature bestows it with a few particular features; 
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.
 • Are not subject to bleeding.
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom.  
 • Gains a bonus to all saves equal to current hitpoints. 
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect the flesh.

**Acid Blood**: Anytime the farokez is struck by a cleave, a weapon attack against the farokez is a critical hit, or an attack would cause the farokex to hemorrhage- everything within 2 feet in the direction of the attack are subject to an acid attack. A farokez is never subject to its own acid. A creature killed by the farokez's acid will be completely consumed by the acid.

**Manipulator Tail**: It's tail can grip and hold an item as though it was a hand, which makes up for the lack of hands.

**Raking Claws**: If the farokez successfully hits with its claw attack, it may use its reaction to inflict a cutting attack against the foe as it rake with its back claws. If it does, it has the foe grappled.

**Great Leap**: The farkez's jumping distance is doubled.

**Limited Infernal Regeneration**: So long as the farokez has its coin undamaged and in its possession, if it has a critical success when it performs an incapacitation save, it may use ts reaction to recover a hitpoint.

**Ancient Coin**: The ancient coin pressed into its head is half-molded to it. If the coin is removed, it will become insane- pursuing it in anyway it can. Any rest it obtains, is treated as one category lesser. If the coin is damaged or destroyed, it is vulnerable until it is mended. If the coin has been destroyed, it loses 1 hitpoint every day. If it does not have any remaining hitpoints, it must perform an incapacitation save at the end of every minute.  
When the coin is damaged or destroyed, it releases a massive amount of energy- inflicting a Ki, Necrotic, Toxic, and Undamaging attack against each creature within 2d4+6 yards. A creature successfully hit by the undamaging attack is knocked back a number of yards equal to the points of success. A critical hit also knocks a creature prone.
