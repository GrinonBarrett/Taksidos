**Darkness**: As an action, he may loose an unnatural smoke that rejects light. This affects everything in a 5 yard cone in a direction of the umbralavi and everything within 3 yards of the umbralavi. All affected creatures must make a [Prcp] save with a DV of 17 or or have their vision and sense of smell completely lost for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure. This smoke persists until the end of the next round, completely blocking any natural light from passing through. He must perform a long or full rest before using this ability again.

**Rake**: As a reaction, if blackbane successfully grapples a creature of equal size or no more than 1 size category larger or smaller, he can use its rear claws to inflict a cutting attack each. If he is grappling a creature within those size limits, he may also perform those claw attacks as a single action without penalty for multiple attacks or brawling with the foe.

**Limited Trample**: Blackbane can trample as though it were a mount, in place of brawling, if it makes contact as a result of sprinting. If he tramples this way, the attack inflicted is a cutting attack. Additionally, if he slams a foe, it inflicts an unarmed attack against that foe.

**Greater Dark Mane**: As an additional option when it has a critical success while brawling, *he may inflict an attack against that foe. If the result is odd, its a necrotic attack. If even, it is a ki attack. Regardless, the critical hit effect is replaced with that of a fire attack, ki attack, and radiant*.

**Startling Speed**: Once per encounter, as an action or reaction, Blackbane may perform a movement.

**Dark Stride**: If Blackbane is not in bright light, he has a flight speed of 12 yards. He cannot enter bright light using this movement.

**Lightning Breath*: As an action, he may spew from its mouth a shower of lightning bolts, effecting a 7 yard line. It is up to .5 foot wide and equally tall. Anything in the area suffers an electric attack attack. Additionally, he chooses a creature in the area when doing so, an additional electrical attack is inflicted against that foe. He must rest before doing so again.

**Wyrding**: Blackbane has learned to cast spells through wyrding, gaining a 1d4 bonus to spellchecks. He knows the following spells;  
*Abatis, Arc Lightning, Blast Lightning, Blessed Orb, Burning Mote, Damper, Disimpress, Jinx, Grasp, Wild Orb, Wisp Away, Zenith*
