#### Special Features

**Immunity**: Itun-Hre is immune to non-magical poisons, venoms, diseases, and sources of toxic damage.

**Gallop**: If Itun-Hre sprinted twice this round, he may use his reaction to perform a movement.

**Troublesome Claws**: Itun-Hre has difficulties accomplishing tasks involving items, due to his claws. Anytime they perform a check involving an item in their claw(s), they treat their attribute as being halved. Additionally, they have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons. Two handed weapons cannot be used.  

**Monstrous Grip**: When Itun-Hre succesfully has a foe grappled, he may squeeze them with his claw as an action to inflict a crushing attack. If he has a greater [Body] score than the grappled creature, he gains a bonus equal to your [Body] bonus.  
While he is grappling a foe, his unarmed attacks against that foe gain a +4 bonus for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit. When he slams a prone foe, if he has an unoccupied claw, he may choose to inflict a crushing attack against that foe.

**Itunari Stinger**: As an additional option when Itun-Hre achieves a critical success while brawling, he may use his stinger attack against that foe. He may also perform such an attack against a foe within 1 foot as a reaction.

**Venom**: When Itun-Hre successfully attacks with his stinger, you may choose to inject venom into the struck creature. If he does, it must succeed a [Fort] save or lose 1 hitpoint. At the end of each round, for the next minute, a new save must be made or the creature will lose another hitpoint. A critical failure insteads reduces the creature by 2 hitpoints. 
Once the venom has been injected, he must rest before producing more venom.
Though the venom's effect is not magical, the venom itself is.  
The DV of the save is 18.

**Blind Fury**: Anytime an attack against Itun-Hre has at least 4 points of success, he becomes blind with fury. At the end of each round he is in this fury, he must succeed a [Will] save with a DV of 18 to end the fury. He has disadvantage on this save if it did not kill or incapacitate a foe during that round. During each round he is subject to this fury, he must attack a another creature during the phase of the round it is capable of doing so. Additionally, he must use his movement during the Primary movement phase to bring himself into range to attack the nearest creature or a creature which has dealt damage to it since the beginning of the previous round.  
When the fury ends, Itun-Hre suffers a level of exhaustion. The Itun-Hre cannot be killed by exhaustion gained this way.
