**Dragon of Adoration**: All dragons are empowered by thier core obsession. For Khauridurafax, it is adoration. It is the air he breathes. He will do whatever he can think of to bring others into the fold of the cult that worships him. For every dozen people who truly worship him like a god, his maximum hitpoints are increased by 1 and he gains a +1 to all checks, saves, and attack rolls. For each player character that worships him, he will have an additional +1 to all checks and saves. Additionally, he can modify the save, check, or attack roll of those that follow him by any amount equal to 1% of those that worship him.  
Against those that do not know his name or refuse to acknowledge him, the benefits he gains for worship (bonuses to checks/saves/attacks, etc) are halved and any save made against abilities/spells from khauridurafax have advantage.

If an entire town falls under his influence, he gains an additional maximum hitpoint. For each shrine and temple of notable status which is errected in his name, he gains an attribute point (the founder's choice).

**Mighty Slam**: When he successfully strikes a foe with his strike or tail attack, he may use his reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, Capralzeryx knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by his weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If he had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

**Breath Weapon**: He is capable of exhaling a line of illusory flames, as an action. The line is 20 yards in length and is a foot high and wide. Anything caught within the line suffers a Psychic attack. Once he has used this ability, he cannot do so again for an hour.  
Alternatively, he may cause the breath weapon to take the form of a cone. Doing so reduces the length to one third of its usual length as he sweeps his head side to side.  

**Swallow Whole**: If he successfully bites a creature of at least two size categories smaller, he may swallow it whole as an action. A creature may be able to cut its way out or succeed an opposed [Rflx] check with disadvantage using their Wrestling skill to escape.

**Strange Healing**: As an action, *he may touch a creature to heal one of its wounds*. He may do so up to 3 separate times. Each instance of this cannot be done again for a number of hours equal to 3d20 multiplied by the number of currently expended uses of this feature and then divded by the total number of entire towns under his control (minimum of 1). 

**Menace**: As an action, anything which can perceive Khauridurafax must succeed a [Will] save with a DV equal to Khauridurafax's [Empy] score + [Will] bonus or be deathly afraid of it. A critical failure forces a creature to be stunned with fear for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure, causing them to be dazed and vulnerable during this time. Khauridurafax may use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the save of a creature it can perceive.

**Draconic Magic**: He is capable of casting spells using wyrding and uses his [Empy] as his [Magic]. He adds his [Empy] bonus to his spellchecks and counterspell checks. He knows the following spells;  
* Alacering
* Animation

* Behest

* Blast Lightning
