**Enkefalophage**: Its hunger is not sated through typical means. It must consume brains to survive. Upon consuming the entirety of a creature's brain, it is considered to have received a number of food portions equal to its [Inte] bonus. If it consumes the brain of a sapient creature (such as a playable species), it instead is considered to have consumed food portions equal to that creature's [Inte] score. It does not benefit from eating the brain of a reanimated creature (such as undead) or another kefalypor. The Thirsting Mind does not need to drink. If it consumes the brain of a creature afflicted by points of inebriation, it immediately gains those points of inebriataion.  
If it conumes a number of servings beyond what it needs during a day equal to its [Inte] score, its [Inte] is permanently increased by 1.

**Limited Senses**: It has no sense of smell, taste, or hearing. It cannot receive stimuli from scents, tastes, or sounds in any capacity as a result (including illusory effects).

**Telepathy**: It can communicate telepathically to any creature within a number of yards equal to its [Inte] score, even if it is on the psychic plane or does not speak a common language.

**Eye Stalk**: It has a single eye stalk. It can rotate its vision. This occurs when rotations would during the round. It can rotate this vision during the same or different phases that it rotates its body. The eye stalk may only rotate up to 90 degrees left or right per phase.

**Telekineticism**: When it is successful with one of its unarmed attacks in any degree, it can use its reaction to move that creature a number of yards equal to the attack roll total + its [Inte] score divided by that creature's weight in stones.

**See Minds**: It may use its concentration to see all non-mindless creatures within 45 yards, including creatures on the psychic plane. This vision projects out from it as a globe. It cannot use any of its other senses, including its traditional form of vision.

**Wyrding**: It is capable of casting spells by wyrding. It knows the following spells (Behest, Phasic Wave, Psychilysis, Psychoburst, Stupify, Telekinesis, Unnatural Lightning) and adds its [Inte] bonus to spell checks and counter spell checks. It also treats its [Inte] as its [Magic] attribute.

**Improved Speed**: *So long as it is not in an area in which magic is supressed, its movement speeds are doubled*.

**Unnatural Speed**: Once per encounter, it *may triple its movement speed for a single move*.

**Very Weak**: Its weight load limits are reduced to one third.

**Fragility**: It rolls one die fewer when performing an incapacitation save.

**Psychoreactive**: The thirsting mind gains an additional reaction which it may use each round to activate a one of its Psychic Powers.

* **Telekinetic Throw**. It throws a creature it perceives a number of yards equal to its [Inte] score divided by that creature's weight in stones.

* **Call Kefalypor**. It sends a telepathic communication. In 1d4+1 rounds, 1d2+1 Kefalypors will arrive to assist the thirsting mind.
