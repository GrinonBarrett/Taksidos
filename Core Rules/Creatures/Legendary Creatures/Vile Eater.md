### Vile Eater
A massive corpse of a once hearty, barrel chested, man. The flesh of its forward lower torso is gone. Its ribs are spread out and exagerated, capable of moving with horrid dexterity to function as a maw. What was its intestines seem to be coiled in its back around the spine. Its toes are long and inhumanly slender, as are the fingers, and devoid of nail.

**Creature Type**: It is undead.

**Size**: The vile eater stands at 8'3". It weighs 268 pounds. It is a large creature.

**Undeath**: It has 360 points of undeath.

**Attributes**:  
[Body] 15 (+5)  
[Fort] 12 (+4)  
[Rflx] 12 (+4)  
[Will] 12 (+4)  
[Inte] 8 (+2)  
[Prcp] 12 (+4)  
[Empy] 6 (+2)  

**Languages**: It doesn't speak.

**Run Speed**: It may run up to 5 yards per move.

**Climb speed**: It may climb up to .5 yard per move, presuming it is reasonable terrain to do so.

**Swim speed**: It may swim up to .5 yard per move, presuming the water isn’t too rough.

**Unarmed Attacks**;

 • Smack: It may use a limb or random object against a foe within 1 foot. This is a melee club attack.

 • Intestinal Whip: The vile eater may lash out at a foe with the coil of internal organs it possesses against a foe within 4.5 yards. This is a melee bare attack. If the attack is a critical hit, the foe is grappled as the intestines wrap around them. Only a single creature can be grappled this way at any time.

 • Gross Bite: The vile eater may attempt to consume a creature it is brawling with by taking it inside of its torso. It inflicts a biting and a necrotic attack when doing so.

#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the vile eater has a few advantages:  
**-** It does not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Unnecessary Consumption**: The vile eater does not need to eat, but is driven to do so. It can restore points of undeath as it eats, regaining 1 per pound of creature consumed. It consumes 3d6 + 10 pounds per round.

**Swallow Whole**: As an additional option when it gets a critical success while brawling, it can attempt to swallow anything of a smaller size than itself into eats rib-bone lined lower maw of a torso. This inflicts a biting attack, necrotic attack, and an acid attack. For each of these attacks which is succesdful, it recoves 2 points of undeath. If a creature dies as a result, it will immediately begin to consume it- consuming 1d10+5 pounds automatically.

**Infectious Bite**: Any beast, humanoid, or sylvan which suffered a biting or necrotic attack from the vile eater that dies before that wound is fully healed has a 15% chance to become an edacious corpse. *This is actually a 35% chance. Additionally, a creature so affected finds its hunger occurs at four times its usual pace*.

[Origin of Vile Eater]: # " Another monster taken from a dream. The dream seemed like it was supposed to be a movie though, unlike the others from dreams. This would be the 4th such creature. "
