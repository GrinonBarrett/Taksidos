**Wrestler**: Aukos is proficienct with the Wrestling skill.

**Long Jump**: When Aukos jumps, it may use its reaaction to triple its leap distance.

**Fleet Foot**: During the first round of an encounter, it may use its action to perform a move.

**Swift Step**: If Aukos would gain exhaustion for sprinting because it ran, it may choose simply not to. It must complete a rest before doing so again.

**Tireless Stride**: If it did not sprint during the previous round, and is performing a sprint, it does not incur fatigue.

**Serviles**: It has a number of serviles that may accompany it into hostile situation. This is exactly like the serviles of an Invoker. The serviles each get their own turn during encounters, but cannot tag with other creatures. Each servile takes their turn simultaneously. When rolling for initiative, they will always take their turn after Aukos'. They act of their own accord, but will obey its command. Commanding any number of serviles is an action or reaction. Commanding all serviles to do the same thing counts as a single order, but otherwise each servile which is to follow an order is treated as being given an individual order. Once a servile is lost, a new one can be recruited by some means appropriate to the type of servile. It may only have a number of serviles equal to 1 + [Empy] bonus. Typically, it keeps skylosian serviles in its band.  
Serviles function as creatures with a limited pool of hitpoints. When a servile is damaged while no hitpoints remain, it is destroyed.

**Engage**: Once per round, it may use its reaction to impose advantage on an attack or check made by one of its serviles which you can perceive.

**Invocation**: Aukos is capable of performing wyrdings. When a spell references its [Magic] score/bonus, it may use its [Prcp] score/bonus. Furthermore, when performing a counter-spell check, you may add your [Prcp] bonus. It knows the following spells (Abatis, Abesnting, Alacering, Breaker Strike, Disenchant, Empathic Ward, Everwarmth, Fortify, Frostbite, Fyrvalder, Isevalder, Landing, Quell, Sobering, Sphere of Oppressive Cold, Thornvalder, Vlepancy, Voice of Familiarity, Wengevalder, Wispaway, Wurmvalder).

**Spiritual Strikes**: It may use its reaction to *inflict a ki attack against a creature it can perceive within a number of yards equal to its [Prcp] score. Additionally, if its unarmed attack would qualify to damage a foe's armor, it may choose instead to inflict a ki attack against that foe*. Furthermore, as an additonal option when achieving a critical success during a brawl, it may inflict a ki attack against that foe.
