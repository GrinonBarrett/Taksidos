#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, tit has a few advantages:  
**-** It does not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Barebone Senses**: It is devoid of organs to sense, but can sense the vibrations in its bones- essentially giving it a sense of hearing and touch.

**Twisted Detection**: During any encounter involving the Vile Guardian, it *knows the exact location of any non-mindless creature with a lower turn order than itself and the location of any undead creature*.

**Wrestler**: It is proficienct in the wrestling skill.

**Tentaculi**: It has eight tentacles which it can use as arms. Seven of them are off hands. It cannot gain any benefit from using more hands than a manfolk would (for example being able to use more than two hands on a sword) unless otherwise noted. This can allow it to wield up to four two-handed weapons. It will typically use at least two for motive power. It cannot use more of them as limbs at a time than its [Rflx] bonus (minimum of 1). Certain tasks which might require fine manipulation, such as trying to pick a lock, are done with disadvantage.

**Wrapping Limbs**: It gains a +3 bonus to parry attempts it performs. It also ignores shields with its melee attacks.

**Octopacing**: It needs two of its limbs for movement. For each additional limb it devotes to the task, it run speed is increased by 1 yard and its climb/swim speeds are increased by 1 foot.

**Magic Resistance**: It gains a 1d6 bonus to defense against magical effects and a 1d8+1 bonus to saves against magical effects.

**Terrifying Leap**: Once per encounter, it may quadruple its leap distance.

**Startling Speed**: Once per encounter, as an action or reaction, it may perform a movement.

**Ward of Mokxiros**: *Undead creatures, other than player characters, cannot detect or otherwise perceive the Vile Guardian*.
