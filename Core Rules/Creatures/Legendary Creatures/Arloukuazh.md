**Dragon of Greed**: All dragons are empowered by thier core obsession. For Arloukazh, and many other dragons, that is wealth. Arloukazh has a horde somewhere in which his own personal wealth is stored. The greater the value, the more benefits he has. He gains the following benefits as appropriate to his horde;  
* For every $500,000 he has, he gain +1 [Body].
* For every $1,000,000 he has, he gains a hitpoint.
* For every $1,250,000 he has, his [Will] increases by 1.
* For every $2,500,000 he has, he gains a +1 bonus to spell checks and counterspell checks.
* For every $3,500,000 he has, his [Fort] is increased by 1.
* For every $5,000,000 he has, he gets a +1 bonus to defense.
* For every $5,250,000 he has, his [Empy] is increased by 1.

These bonuses to attributes and hitpoints are included above.  
Arloukazh's total bonus to spell checks and counter spell checks as a result of this feature is 

**Massive**: For every 3 tons of weight, he has an additional hitpoint. While he has hitpoints, if a wound roll die result is the same as or within 1 step of its current hitpoints, he does not receive a wound. He still loses his hitpoint. When attacked by a weapon or unarmed attack by a smaller creature than himself while it has hipoints- if the attack roll result is equal to its current hitpoints or within a number of steps equal to the difference in size category, he does not receive the wound or lose a hitpoint. This bonus is included above.

**Mighty Slam**: When he successfully strikes a foe with his slam or tail attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the brachiosaurus knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the brachiosaurus' weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the brachiosaurus had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

**Breath Weapon**: He is capable of exhaling a line of flames, as an action. The line is a number of yards in length equal to 10 + 1/1,000,000 of his horde's wealth and is a foot high and wide. Anything caught within the line suffers a Fire attack. Once he has used this ability, he cannot do so again for an hour.  
Alternatively, he may cause the breath weapon to take the form of a cone. Doing so reduces the length to one third of its usual length as he sweeps his head side to side.  
So long as his horde is worth more than $20,000,000- the attacks from this are made with advantage.

**Draconic Magic**: He is capable of casting spells. He adds his [Will] bonus to his spellchecks and counterspell checks. He knows the following spells;
