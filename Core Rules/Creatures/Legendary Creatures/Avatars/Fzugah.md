**Unarmed Attacks**;

 • Strike Mind: The avatar may reach out to a foe within 20 yards to inflict a ranged electric, fire, psychic, or radiant attack. An attack inflicted this way treats a critical hit like that of a fire attack and a psychic attack.

#### Special Features

**Demiphemeral Nature**: This avatar does not have a phsyical form. As such it   
 • Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.  
 • Has disadvantage on [Body] checks.  
 • Is immune to diseases, poisons and venom including toxic damage.  
 • Is not affected by spells which would affect flesh or physically manipulate them.  
 • Is not subject to incapacitation saves.  
 • Cannot be healed except through rest.  
 • Has advantage on saves against effects which would grapple, restrain, or make the avatar prone unless it specifies that they affect ephemera.

**Kzugaine Phase**: The avatar exists in a sliver of reality between the material and psychic planes. This bestows a few features:    
 • Physical objects on the material or psychic plane are completely passable by the avatar if it uses its reaction in response to moving into that space.  
 • It is not subject to the whims of gravity and can retain its position (relatively speaking). It can also move in conformity to gravity.  
 • Non-magical forms of attack have disadvantage on the avatarr.  
 • The avatar cannot be grappled, restrained, or made prone by any non-magical means from the material or psychic plane.  
 • The avatar knows the location of any non-mindless creature within a number of yards equal to its [Prcp] score, even through material obstruction.  
 • It can occupy the same space on the material or psychic plane as another creature.  
 • Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Ungodly Defenses**: The avatar ignores the effects (such as loss of points of undeath) of the first non-magical attack made against it each round. It gains a 1d12 bonus to defense against the first magical attack made against it each round. The first time it performs a save each round, it gains a 1d20 bonus.

**Consuming Being**: When a phase ends, if the avatar occupies the same space as another creature, it inflicts a psychic attack and fire attack against that creature. *It then also inflicts a fire and psychic attack against that creature*. A creature reduced below 0 hitpoints this way, or a creature of undeath reduced to 0 such points, is immediately consumed by the flaming being. All of its knowledge (memories, languages known, etc.) is absorbed by the avatar. Nothing remains of the destroyed creature.

**Globocclusion**: It can see in a complete globe around itself instead of a single direction.

**Glow**: It produces bright light for 5 yards, fair light for 25 yards beyond that, and dim light out for 70 yards beyond that. This glow exists on the material plane and the psychic plane.

**Resist Mundanity**: Non-magical attacks against the avatar cannot be critical hits.

**Eldritch Initiative**: The avatar gains a d20 bonus to initiative rolls. Additionally, if the avatar destroys another creature, it may replace its turn order chit with the destroyed creature.

**Tireless Stride**: Sprinting does not incur exhaustion for the avatar.

**Hurl Flame**: Once per round, as an action or reaction, the avatar may loose flames in a 25 yard line from itself. This line is 3 yards high and 1 yard wide. Anything caught in the line is subject to a fire attack *and a fire attack*. This line remains as a wall of flame for an hour (or until dismissed by the will of the avatar) which inflicts a fire attack against anything which passes through the wall and a fire attack with a 1d4 bonus at the end of any phase a creature occupies the space.

**Whole Mind**: The avatar is immune to effects which affect the mind.

**Fzugah's Cry**: Once per encounter, the avatar may inflict a psychic attack *a sonic attack, and an additional psychic attack,* against everything within a mile.

**Fzugah's Presence**: At the end of every round, each non-mindless creature within 250 yards has its [Inte] lowered by 1. Once a creature's [Inte] is lowered to 0 this way, it becomes mindless and walks towards the avatar until it occupies the same space. If a creature is removed from the effect of the presence, it can make a [Will] save with a DV of 10 + its missing [Inte] to recover a single point of [Inte]. It does this for a number of hours equal to the [Inte] lost this way. A critical failure grants disadvantage on the next save.

**Mighty Presence**: Before initiative is rolled, and at the end of each round, each creature within 250 yards or that can perceive the avatar must succeed a [Will] save with a DV of 17 or become filled with dread and fear. While afraid this way, it has disadvantage on all checks, saves, attacks rolls, rolls for initiative, and is dazed. It must continue to make saves at the end of each round. It has disadvantage on these saves if it is within 250 yards of the avatar and can perceive it. If it is not within 250 yards and cannot perceive it, it gains advantage on the save. A critical failure forces the creature to also make an incapcitation save. A critical success ends the effect. A week without perceiving the avatar reduces the DV by 5.

**Fzugah's Face**: The avatar cannot be seen by any creature unless it is dazed, has [Prcp] 15 or greater, or inebriation of 12 or higher. Its glow can still be seen. A dazed, obtunded, or stuporous creature can see a silhouette of a face in the flames composed by flames of a mismatched color.

**Immolate**: Once per round, the avatar may choose a non-mindless creature which it can perceives, as an action or reaction. *It musts succeed an [Inte] save with a DV of 20 or be beset by a burning mind, suffering inebriation equal to half of the points of failure. It is set ablaze, like a fiery critical hit, for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. It is obtunded during this time. If the save was a critical failure, it is also subject to a psychic and fire attack*.

**Retake Warmth**: Anytime the avater has inflicted a fire attack against a creature successfully, *it may use its reaction to also inflict a cold attack*. If the cold attack qualified to damage armor or was a critical hit, it does not count against the avater's use of their reaction for the round.

[Secret Notes]: # " To make the avatar appropriately durable, let it recover 1d20 points of undeath for every point of [Inte] lost by any creature as a result of its features. 
Additionally, have it spawn 1d4+1 Kzugain when rolling for initiative. Kzugain are not subject to harmful effect's of this avatar's features so long as they serve Fzugah."
