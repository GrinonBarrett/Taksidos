**Wrestler**: The wivre has the wrestling skill.

**Alacrity**: When rolling for initiative, the wivre may use its reaction to move a number of feet equal to its result- so long as it does not exceed the appropriate mode of movement. It decides this after turn order is determined, but before actions are taken.

**Strangling Crush**: As an additional option when it has a critical success while brawling, if it is grappling a foe, it can squeeze the foe to inflict a crushing attack. This gains a +1 bonus to the attack for each size cetgory below the wivre of the creature. If the crushed creature has equal or greater [Body] score, it is only a bonus for the purpose of inflicting a crtitcal hit. This ignores the penalty for the attack while brawling. Additionally, it may simply inflict such an attack as an action if it has a creature grappled.

**Vicious Bite**: As an additional option when it scores critical success while brawling, it may bite the foe it is brawling. This is treated as a Biting attack (ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling).

**Wivre Venom**: Anything struck by the wivre's stinger, or is struck by its biting attack with an odd attack roll result, is also subject to a toxic attack as a result of the venom. If the toxic attack is successful, the struck creature must also succeed a [Fort] save with a DV equal to the attack's total or find themselves slightly parlyzed by the venom. They become vulnerable and have their movement halved while affected by it. At the end of every round, they make a new [Fort] save with a DV of 24 minus the number of rounds they have been affected to shake off the effects.

**Wiry**: It may use its reaction to perform a movement if it did not do so during a previous round and is not grappled or immobilized.

**Wyrding**: The wivre is capable of performing wyrdings. It knows the Flechette spell and 4 others. It is unlikely to perform a wyrding if it has any spell sickness already. It has disadvantage on its wyrding checks and counterspell checks during a solstice, and so will not typically cast any magic at those times.
