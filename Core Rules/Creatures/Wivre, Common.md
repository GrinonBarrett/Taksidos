**Wrestler**: The wivre has the wrestling skill.

**Startling Speed**: Once per encounter, as an action or reaction, the wivre may perform a movement.

**Vicious Bite**: As an additional option when it scores critical success while brawling, it may bite the foe it is brawling. This is treated as a Biting attack (ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling).

**Wivre Venom**: Anything struck by the wivre's stinger, or is struck by its biting attack with an odd attack roll result, is also subject to a toxic attack as a result of the venom. If the toxic attack is successful, the struck creature must also succeed a [Fort] save with a DV equal to the attack's total or find themselves slightly parlyzed by the venom. They become vulnerable and have their movement halved while affected by it. At the end of every round, they make a new [Fort] save with a DV of 24 minus the number of rounds they have been affected to shake off the effects.

**Wiry**: It may use its reaction to perform a movement if it did not do so during a previous round and is not grappled or immobilized.
