### Kentrosaurus
An evolutionary off-shoot of the stegosaurus, these smaller cousins can be found in the furthest reaches of the wilds. Kentrosaurs move in loose herds and will attempt to charge aggressors from multiple directions, pummeling them down to use their spikes. They will retreat if possible when brought down to 2 or fewer hitpoints. Their collective noun is a Herd.

**Thagomizer Precision**: Presuming it is not prone, if a kentrosaurus strikes a foe with its Thagomizer attack, it may use its reaction to inflict an additional piercing attack against the foe.

**Spiked Defense**: If a melee attack is made against the kentrosaurus within 1 yard of the kentrosaurus, it may use its reaction to inflict a piercing attack against that creature. If foe's attack was a critical failure, it gains advantage on its attack.  
Additionally, a creature of equal or greature size which attempts to brawl or trample the kntrosaurus is subject to a piercing attack.
