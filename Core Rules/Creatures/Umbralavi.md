**Darkness**: As an action, the umbralavi may loose an unnatural smoke that rejects light. This affects everything in a 5 yard cone in a direction of the umbralavi and everything within 3 yards of the umbralavi. All affected creatures must make a [Prcp] save with a DV of 15 or or have their vision and sense of smell completely lost for a number of minutes equal to the points of failure. This smoke persists until the end of the next round, completely blocking any natural light from passing through. The umbralavi must perform a long or full rest before using this ability again.

**Rake**: As a reaction, if the umbralavi successfully grapples a creature of equal size or no more than 1 size category larger or smaller, it can use its rear claws to inflict a cutting attack each. If it is grappling a creature within those size limits, it may also perform those claw attacks as a single action without penalty for multiple attacks or brawling with the foe.

**Limited Trample**: An umbralavi can trample as though it were a mount, in place of brawling, if it makes contact as a result of sprinting. If it tramples this way, the attack inflicted is a necrotic attack. Additionally, if it slams a foe, it inflicts an unarmed attack against that foe.

**Dark Mane**: As an additional option when it has a critical success while brawling, *it may inflict an attack against that foe. If the result is odd, its a necrotic attack. If even, it is a ki attack. Regardless, the critical hit effect is replaced with that of a fire attack*.

**Startling Speed**: Once per encounter, as an action or reaction, the umbralavi may perform a movement.

**Dark Stride**: If the umbralavi is not in bright light, it has a flight speed of 9 yards. It cannot enter bright light using this movement.

**Lightning Breath*: As an action, it may spee from its mouth a shower of lightning bolts, effecting a 5 yard line. It is up to .5 foot wide and equally tall. Anything in the area suffers an electric attack attack. Additionally, it chooses a creature in the area when doing so, an additional electrical attack is inflicted against that foe. It must rest before doing so again.
