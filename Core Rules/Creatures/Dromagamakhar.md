### Dromagamakhar
A bipedal predator that does not have a proper mouth. Instead, its head plays host to a single large eye, crowned with four "spitter stalks" it uses to digest prey. It has a neck frill which flares out when it suspects a magical threat or intends to intimidate a potential foe. It features a short sail on its back which helps to regulate its temperature. The forward claws appear to be short wings, but are primarily used to aid its swim speed. They look to have a sort of "fleshy beard" dangling from the underside of their head, which is composed of feeding tubes used to sop up the mess left behind when their acids have digested prey. The plural is dromagamakhain. Their collective noun is a pack. They have a 50% chance to be found solitary, otherwise they can be found in a pack of 1d4+1.

**Mighty Slam**: When the dromagamakhar successfully strikes a foe with its ram attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the dromagamkhar knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the dromagamakhar's weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the dromagamkhar had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

**Great Eye**: The dromagamakhar's eye is capable of seeing magic, piercing through illsuory magics, and seeing creatures made invisible by magical effcts.

**Detecting Frill**: As an action, the dromagamakhar may unfold its frill in a starling pattern. This is actually an additional sensory organ which it keeps folded along its neck. The frill can expand out between 13-15" from the neck. This allows it a form of sight which can only detect magic, including creatures made invisible by a magical effect, and potentially detecting spell sickness. It can also detect if a creature is casting a spell. For the purpose of detecting a stealthy creature, the dromagamakhar gains a bonus to visually detecting another creature equal to that creature's spell sickness. If it is facing a creature with spell sickness that is not hiding, even if its eye is wounded, it can see it.

**Acid Spewing Stalks**: Each of the dromagamakhar's four spitter stalks can fire a spray of acid which can inflict an acid attack against a foe within 5 yards. If performed within 2 yards, the attack gains advantage. A stalk can attempt to spew to the side directions of the dromagamkhar, but have disadvantage on such an attack. If the attack roll result is a 13, 17, or 20 and the attack is successful, it inflicts an additional acid attack.

**Startling Speed**: Once per encounter, as an action or reaction, the dromagamakhar may perform a movement.

**Terrifying Leap**: Once per encounter, the dromagamakhar may quadruple its leap distance.
