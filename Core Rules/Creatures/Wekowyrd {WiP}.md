**Breathless**: The wekowyrd does not need to breathe.



**Limited Senses**: .

**Mighty Slam**: When the ajhas successfully strikes a foe with its slam attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the ajhas' check is a success in any degree, it knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the ajhas' weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the ajhas had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

**Reactionary Mutation**: Anytime the creature is wounded, if the attack roll result was odd, it mutates as a result of the wound it receives. Roll 2d20 and compare the toal result to the chart above to determine the result of the mutation.

**Magic Disruption Field**: Anytime the wekowyrd mutates, it performs a counterspell check against all creatures casting spells within 10 miles.

It may levitate up to 5 yards per move so long as it is not dazed.

**Acidic Aura**: The ajhas constantly express a fine mist which can reach out up to 10 yards. After an ajhas leaves a space, this aura lasts in a space for twice as long as it remain in that space. At the end of each round, a creature in the aura is subject to an Acid attack. Additionally, anything which breathes in the aura must succeed a [Fort] save or incur hemorrhaging. The DV is equal to 10 + the number of rounds the creature has remained in the hour for the past minute. Additionally, all [Prcp] checks involving scent or vision through the bland colored mist have disadvantage. Light going through the mist will always seem dim. An ajhas is unaffected by this feature to any degree.

**Grapplock**: When performing an opposed check while brawling or grappling, the die level of any dice rolled by the ajhaswekowyrd is increased by 2. If an unarmed attack by this creature against a foe is a critical hit, and it has at least two free appendages, it may grapple that creature.

**Swallow Whole**: If the ajhas successfully grapples a creature of at least two size categories or smaller, it swallows it whole. A creature may be able to cut its way out or succeed an opposed [Rflx] check with disadvantage using their Wrestling skill to escape.

**Consuming**: Anything in the ajhas' stomach is subject to the digestive acids it contains. At the end of each phase, a swallowed creature is subject to an 2 acid attacks, a necrotic attack, and a crushing attack with advantage. Even if the creature escapes, it is still subject to an acid attack at the end of the round it escaped.

**Supernatural Speed**: When the wekowyrd sprints, it *may quadruple its movement speed for that move*. Additionally, if it does not sprint during a round, it may use its reaction to *triple its speed*.
