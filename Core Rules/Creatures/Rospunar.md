**Mighty Slam**: When the rospunar successfully strikes a foe with its strike attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the rospunar knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the rospunar's weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the rospunar had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

**Built for Bounding**: The rospunar's leap distance is multiplied by its size category (times 4 as a large creature).

**Color Pattern**: The rospunar gets a +4 visually based bonus to its stealth in its home environment.

**Terrifying Leap**: Once per encounter, the rospunar may quadruple its leap distance.

**Smoky Veil**: During the first round of an encounter, the rospunar may expel smoke out up to 5 yards from itself. All visually based checks into the area have disavnatage, as do any attack rolls in or through the smoke. The rospunar only suffers a -1 penalty instead while affected by such smoke. The smoke dissapates at the end of the 3rd round.
