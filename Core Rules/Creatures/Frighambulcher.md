#### Special Features 

**Wrestler**: The frighambulcher has the Wrestling skill.

**Minimal Sensing**: The frighambulcher is, in the most technical sense, blind. It is also devoid of the senses of smell and hearing. Instead it relies on sensing vibrations and its ability to taste what it comes in contact with. Anytime it would attempt a check or save based on perceiving something, it has disadvantage (likewise, it should get advantage against illusions based on such stimuli). If it would rely on multiple missing senses, it suffers an additional -2 penalty for each total sense. If it is touching or tasting something, it does not have any issues identifying it.

**Unpeeled Maw**: If the frighambulcher has successfully bitten a foe with its maw attack, it may attempt to fully engulf it by using its reaction to grapple it.

**Swallow Whole**: If the frighambulcher successfully grapples a creature of equal or smaller size, it swallows it whole. A creature may be able to cut its way out or succeed an opposed [Rflx] check using their Wrestling skill to escape. 

**Stomach Acid**: ANything in the frighambulcher's stomach is subject to the digestive acids it contains. At the end of each phase, a swallowed creature is subject to an acid attack. Even if the creature escapes, it is still subject to such an attack at the end of the round it escaped.
