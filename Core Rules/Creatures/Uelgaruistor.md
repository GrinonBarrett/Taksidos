### Uelgaruistor
This creature is covered in proto-feathers. Instead of traditional talons, it has 8 small webbed claws which tuck into the body, the fluff of which helps smooth out the body shape. The spikes of its thagomizer relax into the tail's sillhouette. Their necks sport unique color patterns for identification. These feathers get ruffled when startled or when trying to intimidate.

#### Special Features

**Thagomizer Swing**: Once per round, when its unarmed attack would be a critical hit or it slams a brawling opponent, it may use its reaction to do one of the following;

* It may have that creature perform a [Body] save with a DV equal to its [Body] score. On a failure, that creature is knocked prone until the end of the round. On a critical failure, it is also vulnerable during this time.  
If the foe has a greater [Rflx] score than the ???, it gains advantage on the save.

* Inflict a Club attack against that creature.

* Inflict a Piercing attack against that creature.

**Rending Claws**: As an additional option when it succeeds a critical success while brawling, it may claw the foe whom it is brawling. This is treated as a Cutting attack (ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling).

**Vicious Bite**: As an additional option when it succeeds a critical success while brawling, it may bite the foe whom it is brawling. This is treated as a Biting attack (ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling)
