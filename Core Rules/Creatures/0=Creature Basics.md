## REACTIONS FROM CREATURES
Whenever the players encounter creatures, it may be fit to determine how they react to the player. Roll a die 20 and compare it the creature's reaction chart to determine its "emotion" and the intensity of that emotion. Some examples of emotions and their intensity are included below, but a creature's reaction chart may include special notes.  
Sapient creatures will not have a reaction table specific to them. Certain creatures, such as undead, do not have a reaction table. Those creatures are recommended to only be used with an explicit pretense by the narrator and thus the creature's motivations would already be determined.

Hostility
 1) Is not fighting outright, but will be oppositional to the party.
 2) Not actively attacking the players, but is likely being territorial and may engage if provoked.
 3) Immediate Combat with the intent of doing harm to the party.

Fear
 1) Apprehensive to dealing with the party.
 2) Will go out of their way to avoid the party.
 3) Will attempt to avoid the party entirely, but if engaged will strike out of fear (having disadvantage) to produce an opportunity to escape.

Amicability
 1) You get "the look".
 2) You get a friendly greeting.
 3) It will perform some freindly gesture as appropriate to the creature.

Greed
  1) It will seem to investigate the party some from afar.
  2) It will attempt to take something loose from the party as appropriate to the creature.
  3) It will attack you and loot the bodies. It is very much likely to retreat if you can turn the tables on them.

Curiosity
 1) You get a funny look.
 2) It will approach you, yet be reluctant.
 3) They will begin to follow you, stealthily or otherwise.

Hunger
 1) If you have any food, it will be curious about it.
 2) It will attempt to steal food from the party.
 3) It will attack either the weakest member of the party to eat or a weaker member to take any food from them.
