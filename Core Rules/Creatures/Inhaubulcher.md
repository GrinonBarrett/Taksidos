#### Special Features 

**Marine Breathing**: The inhaubulcher can breathe just fine in regular air or water.

**Spell Resistance**: The inhaubulcher gets a bonus to defense and saves against spells equal to that spell's tier.

**Inhaubulcher's Oil**: The inhaubulcher's body produces an oily substance which is quite flammable and dissolve's mucous. The inhaubulcher is immune to the effects of the Mucous feature. Additionally, if it is leaking oil, fire attacks against the inhaubulcher automatically apply the critical effect of fire attacks (this does not make the attack an automatic critical success). Anything covered in the inhaubulcher's oil is subject to the same. Potent alcohol will eliminate the substance.
Anytime the inhaubulcher brawls with a creature, that creature becomes covered in the substance.

**Exploding Death**: If the inhaubulcher dies as a result of fire, a necrotic attack, a spell which instantly kills it, or massive damage- it tick like appendages fly everywhere. An attack roll is made against every creature within 1 yard. If the die result against a creature is even, it is a toxic attack. If odd, it is a biting attack. This cannot inflict a critical hit.
