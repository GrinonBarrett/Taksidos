#### Making an Infernal Diva Creature
All features of the original creature are lost. The diva gains a benefit to each attribute equal to the original creature's bonus for those attributes. A player character could be converted this way, but it is not recommended. The character would lose all of its former abilities. Additionally, it is essentially a demon in service to a more powerful fiend- limiting the roleplaying potential. Furthermore, there is no advancement as such a creature.
