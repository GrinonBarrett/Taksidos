### Templates
Templates are mostly complete stat blocks intended to easily be modified to make either a powerful foe by the narrator or to allow player characters to become something far different. Wehn applying the template to a character, the character retains all features unless it is contradicted by the template. If the character and the template both have features of the same name, use the templates versions. Additionally, use the templates attributes, but increase them each by the player's attribute bonuses. When creating a creature with the template, follow the included note about creating a creature from them.
