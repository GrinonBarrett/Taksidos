### Shadelaird
A being that exists long beyond whatever life they have earned. These creatures are unapologetically malicious. Though they may vary in the aggressivness of their evil, their existence cannot ultimately produce good in the world- save perhaps inspiring a few individuals to take on heroic mantles. Even then, the damage inflicted upon the world by their deeds and schemes outweighs what any hero is capable of.

#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the shadelaird has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Voidtouched**: It has seen the veil and, as a result, is numb to the fears of mortality. Unless specified otherwise, fear based effects cannot affect the shadelaird.

**Supernatural Speed**: When the shadelaird sprints, it may *quadruple its movement speed for that move*. Additionally, if it does not sprint during a round, it may use its reaction to *triple its speed*.

**Terrifying Presence**: When initiative is rolled, anything else rolling for initiative must succeed a [Will] save with a DV equal to the shadelairds's [Will] score + [Empy] bonus or be deathly afraid of it. A critical failure forces a creature to be stunned with fear for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure, causing them to be dazed and vulnerable during this time. A creature which can directly percieve the shadelaird, has no remaining hitpoints, and a [Will] score below the shadelaird is killed by the fear.  

**Menace**: As an action, anything which can perceive the shadelaird must succeed a [Will] save with a DV equal to the shadelairds's [Empy] score + [Will] bonus or be deathly afraid of it. A critical failure forces a creature to be stunned with fear for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure, causing them to be dazed and vulnerable during this time. The shadelaird may use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the save of a creature it can perceive.

**Grave Magic**: The shadelaird is capable of casting magic using the very power of undeath that animates it. It functions like wyrding with the following exceptions: 
* It rolls a d20 and adds its horrorism to its roll to determine the check result.
* On a success, it loses points of undeath equal to the spell's tier instead of gaining spell sickness.
* On a failue, it loses points of sucess equal to the points of failure or spell's tier (whichevever is higher).
* On a critical failure, it loses points of undeath equal to the points of failure multiplied by the tier of the spell.
* When completing the spell, it may roll any number of d8s. It loses points of undeath equal to the result, but gains a +1 bonus to its check for die rolled this way.  

This is in addition to any other spellcasting methods it has.

**Horrorism**: THe shadelaird has a bonus to certain features. THis functions exactly as Heroism for player characters, though the value is determined by the manner in which this template is used.

**Nercrotic Magics**: Anytime the shadelaird inflicts an attack as a result of a spell, it may alter it to be a necrotic attack. If it was already a necrotic attack, it may alter it to be one of the following attcks instead (Handaxe, Mace, Biting, Acid, Cold, Electric, Fire, Toxic). If it does so while possessing spell sickness, it must use its reaction to do so or accrue an additional point of spell sickness.

**Dark Shield**: Anytime the shadelaird is attacked, it may use its reaction to take on 1d4 points of spell sickness. If it does, it gains a bonus to defense against that attack equal to the result and loses an equal number of points of undeath.

-----

#### Shadelairds as Creatures
The shadelaird gains an additional 100 points of undeath for every hitpoint the base creature would have had.  
They are also treated as being 5th level in a class of the your choice. Count the total hitpoints from the base creature AND the class combined for determining the extra points of undeath. It exchanges its Heroism for Horrorism, but the values are the same as a fifth level character of the chosen class. A shadelaird jester would lower their Horroism in place of their Heroism for example. THey also gain the following:

**Magical Knowledge**: A shadelaird knows 9 basic spells and 2 legendary spells. This is in addition to any spells learned from other methods.

**Skills**: The shadelaird knows a number of skills it possessed in life, plus a number qual to its [Inte] bonus.

**Weapon training**: The shadelaird retains all weapon training it had in life, and has a total number of additional levels of training to distribute as it wishes equal to the greater of its [Rflx] bonus or [Body] bonus.

#### Shadelairds as Characters
***Not* recommended at all**  
The character still progresses as normal. When they would receive extra hitpoints for leveling, they are converted to additional points of undeath as noted above. It exchanges its Heroism for Horrorism, but the values are the same as the heroism for its level. A shadelaird jester would lower their Horroism in place of their Heroism for example.  
The wound chart is replaced with that of a shadelaird, even if it did not previously use one. All Biased attacks of the previous wound chart overwrite the entires on the new chart to produce a new wound chart for the character.
