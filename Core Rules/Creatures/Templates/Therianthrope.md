### Therianthrope
Typically, a therainthrope comes about as the result of a curse. But there are many causes. Additionally, there are similar forms of curses that can function similarly, such as lycanthropy, but have far more changes to the afflicted creature. A therianthrope's condition is associated with one of a number of creatures. THere is a legend of powerful mages who have managed to willfully attain therianthropy of many beasts, but this path is not recommended for anyone.

**Multiple Forms**: The creature with this template has a "base" form and a "beast" form. Its base form is its standard form. The beast form is a form which, except where noted here, functions identically to that of the associated creature.

**Transformation**: The time required to transform from the base form to beast form is the number of points of difference between the [Body] score and [Fort] score 
of each form plus Xd4, where X is 1 + the difference in size categories between forms. These are full round actions and disrupt the concentration of the transforming creature. If a form is of a diffent creature type, the di(c)e rolled is d6 instead. It is vulnerable during this time.  
What exactly causes the transformation varies by curse, though some may even be able to do so at will.

**Attribute Changes**: The attribute scores of each the base form and the beast form is modified, with each calculated individually. The base form loses a number of points in each attribute equal to its current bonus, but gains points equal to the beast's bonus for each attribute appropriately. Likewise, its beast form loses points in each attribute equal to its bonus but gains points equal to the unmodified bonus of its base form. Once determined, they are applied and cannot be reversed.

**Material Vulnerability**: Often times, this curse is accompanied by a vulnerability to a particular metal, mineral, or other material. Thi varies by curse. Contact with the material will be uncomfortable and any attack from a weapon of that material gets advantage against the therianthrope.
