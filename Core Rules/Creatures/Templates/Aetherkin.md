|   2    | Crippled          | Its movement speed is halved until this wound is healed.      |
|   3    | Collapse          | **Biased wound**. It collapses on to the ground in a pile of bones, becoming vulnerable during the next phase. During the phase afterwards, it begins to reassemble, being prone and foregoing an action. The phase following that it functions as normal. |
|   4    | Rattle            | The shadelaird is prone until end of round. |
|   5    | Broken Bone       | The shadelaird is prone until the end of the next round. |
|   6    | Glancing Blow     | No ill effects. |
|   7    | Rattle            | **Biased wound**. It is prone until the end of the next round. |

|   13   | Faux Redeath      | It appears to be destroyed and accrues 1d4 points of spell sickness. It will become inert for a number of minutes equal to its current spell sickness. It either reanimates or suddenly appears somewhere close by (time to be dramatic narrator!). Anything done to the remains while inert will have no effect on the shadelaird. If a moment passes where nothing perceives the inert remains, the shadelaird may choose to have them "disappear". |
|   14   | Broken Bone       | It is prone until the end of the next round. |
|   15   | Bell Rung         | The next attack made against it before the end of the next round gets advantage.  |

#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the aetherkin has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**A Fear Beyond Death**: It has seen the veil and, as a result, cannot tolerate what it knows will come to it. It does not benefit from horrorism for saves against fear. Additionally, so long as it has belowe 100 points of undeath, it suffers a -1 to all saves against fear for every 45 points of undeath it is missing. If it is ever brought to 10 or fewer points of undeath, it automatically fails every save against fear effects.

**Horrorism**: THe shadelaird has a bonus to certain features. THis functions exactly as Heroism for player characters, though the value is determined by the manner in which this template is used.

**Aetherkin Nature**: All aetherkin must yield to the command of Ba'Althazar if heard- regardless of their creator.

-----

#### Aetherkin as Creatures
The aetherkin gains an additional 90 points of undeath for every hitpoint the base creature would have had. They also gain the following:

**Magical Knowledge**: An aetherkin retains any spellcasting or other magic features it had.

**Skills**: The aetherkin retains its skills from life

**Weapon training**: The aetherkin retains all weapon training it had in life.

#### Shadelairds as Characters

The character still progresses as normal. When they would receive extra hitpoints for leveling or other features, they are converted to additional points of undeath as noted above. It exchanges its Heroism for Horrorism, but the values are the same as the heroism for its level. An aetherkin jester would lower their Horroism in place of their Heroism for example.  
The wound chart is replaced with that of an aetherkin, even if it did not previously use one. All Biased attacks of the previous wound chart overwrite the entries on the new chart to produce a new wound chart for the character.
