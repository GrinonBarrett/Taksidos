#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the shadelaird has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Mindless**: Plague Birthed do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing affects and fear-based effects.

**Plague Spreader**: The plague birthed does not suffer the effects of a disease, but can immediately spread it by contact with an unarmed attack from or against it.

**Parting Plague**: When the Plague Birthed is destroyed by a means other than Fire or Necrotic damage, it leaves a toxic fog which streches out in a 1 foot in all directions from the place of its destruction. This fog last a number of rounds equal to its maximum points of undeath. The fog slowly expands, at a rate of .5 foot per round, up to a total of 12 total feet. Anything in the fog immediately suffers any diseases possesed by the Plague Birthed, including magical diseases.

-----

#### Applying the Template
The plague birthed cannot be a construct, ephemera, elemental or fiend. The plague birthed gains an additional 10 points of undeath for every hitpoint the base creature would have had. The plague birthed retains all senses (no matter how limited) of the original creature.
