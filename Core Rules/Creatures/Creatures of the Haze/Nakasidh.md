**Nimble Flight**: While flying, the nakasidh adds its [Rflx] bonus to its defense against all attacks made at a range of 5 yards or greater. It does not gain this benefit while prone.

**Four Claws**: The nakasidh has four claws, each is considered an off hand.

**Shocking Grasp**: As an additional option upon a crtical success while brawling with a creature, the nakasidh may loose a surge of electricity against the foe to inflict an electric attack with advantage.

**Winged Lunge**: As an action or reaction, a nakasidh may push itself away from a surface or object capable of bearing its weight and perform a small burst of flight. It is treated as performing a jump, with the maximum height and distance doubled. This movement does not count against its limitation on flying in the round.
