#### Special Features

**Abdominal Eye**: The raised abdomen of the enkongedh is an advanced sensory organ which confers the following;  
* It can see in a 200 degree arc behind itself. This prevents foes from taking advantage of attacking its rear.  
* It can see infrared emissions, allowing it to see warm blooded creatures.
* It is able to detect the presence of magic and the ki possessed by creatures.
* It may *perform a ranged radiant attack. This functions identically to a wand for all intents and purposes*. This attack can be fired forward as normal or through the creature's rear direction. It cannot be fired more than once per round nor on consecutive rounds.
