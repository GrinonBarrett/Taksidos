### Wellarch
A well spirit which has evolved over centuries or been born along the world's leylines. Wellarchs can be benevelent wards, ensuring the health of respectful patrons to its well, or they can be brutally malicious- spreading sickness and plague to those who dare to draw from its well. It is a common thing to place a gold coin into the bucket you draw from the well with. If there is a benevolent wellarch, it will appreciate the kind gesture and may either take it or leave it.
