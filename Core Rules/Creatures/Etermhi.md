### Etermhi
Also known as pool spirits, they are attached to natural bodies of water. They cannot leave these bodies unless magically aided or forced. Good etermhi try to assist those in genuine need and will allow others to rest at their springs. Evil etermhi are either greedy, requiring tribute to be paid into the pool before its use, or brutally tricky- tainting the pool to make visitors sick. Etermhi disdain combat with great passion. If they are to dispose of a creature, they would rather poison them or drown them. If the etermhi does not seem capable of winning a fight, it will retreat into its pool.

**Creature Type**: Etermhi are Elemental creatures.

**Size**: Etermhi take a form that can fit within a 2 yard cube. Their weight is always equal to the weight of their pool. They are considered medium creatures.

**Languages**: Etermhi speak Hydroglossa and one other language common to the area they reside within.

**Hitpoints**: An etermhi has 2 hitpoints by default, but can have their maximum hitpoints increased according to their pool.

[Fort] 9 (+3)  
[Rflx] 9 (+3)  
[Will] 9 (+3)

#### Special Features

**Amorphous Elemental**: Etermhi are flowing and graceful spirits of water. As such they;  
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom.  
 • Immune to the effects of bloodloss.
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh.  
 • Receives wounds, but no effect from them. 
 • Immunity to falling and knockback damage.  
 • Obstacles that would reduce the speed of it have only half of their normal effect unless they specifically affect amorphous creatures as well.  
 • Anytime a spell would be cast against it that would affect its form, shape, composition, or mental state- it gains a d12 bonus to its saves against that effect.  
 • It cannot be grappled.  
 • While the it has a creature grappled, it can treat that creature as being unarmored for the purpose of attacking it.  
 • It is capable of traveling through any opening small enough to stick one’s fist.  
 • Cannot use armor, shields, or any item.   
 • Receives wounds, but no effect from them.

**Body of Water**: For every 650 gallons of water in the etermhi's pool, its [Body] is increased by 1. For every 1300 gallons the etermhi's pool has, its maximum hitpoints are increased by 1.

**Spirit's Pool**: While within its own pool, an etermhi has several benefits;  
 • Swim Speed is tripled.   
 • Can cast the Waterworking spell as awyrding with a +1 bonus to its spell check and counterspell checks equal to +1 per 650 gallons in its pool.  
 • +2 bonus to all saves against magical effects.

**Water Jet**: The etermhi can use an action or reaction to create a jet of water using water it is touching. This can reach out a number of yards equal to the creature's current hitpoints, with the optimal range being half as far. Treat as a club attack. If using water from the etermhi's pool, treat as a force attack instead.

**Etermhi's Gift**: When a creature drinks enough water from the pool to slate its thirst, the etermhi may apply up to any two of the following effects to that creature;
* Restore a single hitpoint.
* Cure an instance of hemorrhaging.
* Cure all non-magical poisons.
* Cure a non-magical disease.
* Improve Swim speeds by 2 yards for an hour.
* Cure a magical poison.
* Inflict a toxic wound.
* Inflict a ki wound.
* Inflict a cold wound.
* Inflict an acid attack.
* The creature must perform a [Fort] save with a DV equal to half of the Etermhi’s current hitpoints or be afflicted by the critical hit of an acid attack.

The etermhi may only do this once between full rests per 300 gallons in its pool.
