### Thoron
Wardens of the deep woods. These four legged beasts bear flesh like wood, adorned with thorns. They are fast and strong, to the amazement of any that see their figure. It's head appears to be a clubtail covered in brambles and branches with no visible eyes.  
They are considered the violent defenders of nature- Not something to be reasoned with and unlikely to be dissuaded when they arrive.

**Size**: Thorons are between 6-9 feet tall (though only 5-6 feet at the shoulders), about 20% longer than their height length, and feature thick legs which could alomst stretch out as wide as their length. They can weigh between 1,000 and 1,200 pounds. They are large creatures.

**Languages**: Thorons don't speak. They understand other creatures that speak the Fair Tongue.

#### Special Features

**Plant Nature**: As a plant creature, the thoron has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe or sleep. They must still rest.  
**-** Immunity to diseases unless they specifically affect plants.  
**-** Immunity to Bloodloss.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated except by an effect which explicitly affects plants.  

**Lignimeld**: Once per minute, _the Thoron may pass through ligneous material, such as wood, as though it were simple air_. It does so until it is no longer in contact with such material.

**Tree Skipping**: Once per encounter, when the thoron's movement would allow it to enter the space of a tree if said tree were not itself an obstacle, _it passes through the tree and exits through another tree within 1 mile_. 

**Great Leap**: Once per encounter, when the thoron jumps, it can leap up to three times its normal distance.
