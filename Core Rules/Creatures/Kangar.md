**Mighty Slam**: When the kangar successfully strikes a foe with its slam attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the kangar knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the mirkar's weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the mirkar had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

**Menacing Blow**: When the kangar successfully attacks a creature, it may use its reaction force that creature to make a [Will] save with a DV equal to the points of success + the kangar's [Will] bonus and [Empy] bonus. On a failure, it is overcome with fear- the creature is dazed for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. On a critical failure, it is also vulnerable during this time.

**Snow Diving**: If the kangar is completely covered in snow, to the point that no part of it is visible, *it may instantly tranpsort itself anywhere within 3 miles so long as it would still be covered in snow at its destination*.
