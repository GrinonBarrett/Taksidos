#### Special Features

**Elemental Nature**: Chills are animated manifestations of wild, natural, forms of energy. As such they;  
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom.  
 • Immune to the effects of bloodloss.
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh.  

**Immunities**: The chill cannot be damaged by cold attacks or effects.

**Cold Regeneration**: If it is below 50 degrees, the chill has a 1 in 6 chance to recover a hitpoint at the end of each round. If it is below 0 degrees, it is increased to a 1 in 4 chance.

**Chill Aura**: At the start of each round, all creatures within 25 yards must succeed a [Fort] save with a DV of 10 or be chilled. A creature chilled this way has all forms of movement speed halved and all skill checks made by an affected creature have a -2 penalty. The attacks of the chill and other chills, and cold attacks, have advantage against such chilled creatures.

**Cold Ray**: Once per encounter, and an additional time between rests, the chill may hurl a ray of intense cold. This functions as a cold wand attack for all intents and purposes.

**Cold Touch**: When the chill successfully hits a creature, it may use its reaction to inflict a special cold effect. Treat as a cold attack against that same creature with the following eceptions.  
* A d12 is rolled instead of a d20.
* The Chill gains a bonus equal to its [Empy] bonus to the attack roll.

**Cold Unrest**: Humanoids and Fey, when destroyed by the cold damage of a chill, have their consciousness transformed into a Frozen Spectre. It generally will not cast spells if it already has spell-sickness.

**Wyrdings**: A chill may cast wyrdings. It knows the following spells,
* Frost Lance
* Frostbite
* Sphere of Oppressive Cold
