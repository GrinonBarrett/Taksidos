**-** They do not need to breathe or sleep. They must still rest.  
**-** Immunity to diseases unless they specifically affect plants.  
**-** Immunity to Bloodloss.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated except by an effect which explicitly affects plants.  

**Acrobatic Extraordinaire**: The cordogobil is proficiant with both the Athletics and Wrestling skills.

**Gourd-Thing**: Receives wounds but not the effects of them. If an attack would qualify to damage armor, it instead removes the cordogobil's hand. If this happens again before it can grow a new one (which takes 1d8+1 days of long or full rest), it is simply slain.

**Frail**: Does not benefit from attributes bonuses when performing incapacitation saves.

**Spiney**: Anytime a creature within 1 foot attempts an unarmed attack against the cordogobil, the cordogobil is trampled, a brawl is initiated involving the cordogobil, or a movement phase ends while the cordogobil is brawling with another creature, inflict a piercing attack with a -4 penalty against that creature.
