**Nimble Flight**: While flying, the tessariftorai adds its [Rflx] bonus to its defense against all attacks made at a range of 5 yards or greater. It does not gain this benefit while prone.

**Quadrachroma**: Tessariftoroi have 4 chroma in their eyes. As a result they gain a +3 to all [Prcp] checks involving sight.

**Breath Weapon**: Tessariftoroi are capable of exhaling a line of flames, as an action. The line is 3 yards long and is a quarter foot high and wide. Anything caught within the line suffers a Fire attack. Once it draconne has used this ability, it cannot do so again until if finishes a lonf or full rest.  
Alternatively, it may cause the breath weapon to take the form of a cone. Doing so reduces the length to a single yard as it sweeps its head side to side.

**Additional Wings**: The tessariftorai only needs three of its wings to operate, but gains advantages for devoting all four to flight for the round. Its flight speed is increased by 5 yards if it is not prone.

**Dive**: If the tessariftorai flies at least 20 yards in the previous round, it gets a bonus on its first attack made before the primary movement phase of the current round. This bonus is equal to one-tenth of the total yards moved since the beginning of the previous round.

**Tail Sweep**: Once per round, when its unarmed attack would be a critical hit or it slams a brawling opponent, it may use its reaction to do one of the following;

* It may have that creature perform a [Body] save with a DV equal to its [Body] score (13). On a failure, that creature is knocked prone until the end of the round. On a critical failure, it is also vulnerable during this time.  
If the affected foe has a greater [Rflx] score than the tessariftorai, it gains advantage on the save.

* Inflict a Club attack against that creature with a -1 penalty.
