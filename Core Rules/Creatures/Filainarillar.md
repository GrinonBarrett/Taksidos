**Massive**: For every 3 tons of weight, the filainarillar has an additional hitpoint (resulting in an amount between 10-13 additional hitpoints this way). While it has hitpoints, if a wound roll die result is the same as or within 1 step of its current hitpoints, it does not receive a wound. The creature still loses its hitpoint. When attacked by a weapon or unarmed attack by a smaller creature than iself while it has hipoints- if the attack roll result is equal to its current hitpoints or within a number of steps equal to the difference in size category, it does not receive the wound or lose a hitpoint.

**Mighty Slam**: When the filainarillar successfully strikes a foe with its strike or tail attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to perform an opposed [Body] check. If the filainarillar's check is a tie or success in any degree, it knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the fillainarillar's weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the fillainarillar had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

**Keen Oralfactory Senses**: When applying its [Prcp] bonus to checks/saves involving sense of smell, it instead applies its [Prcp] score instead.

**Terrifying Roar**: Once per encounter, the filainarillar may loose a terrifying roar as a full round action. Anything within half a half-mile must succeed a [Will] save with a DV equal to the filainarillar's [Will] score + [Empy] bonus or be deathly afraid of the ???. A critical failure forces a creature to be stunned with fear for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure, causing them to be dazed and vulnerable during this time.

**Breath Weapon**: The filainarillar can exhude a devastating breath weapon as an action. This has two primary effects.  
1) It produces a bright beam which extends in a 100 yard line, which is .5 yards high and wide. It can sweep its head back and forth to instead produce a 55 yard cone. Anything caught within is subject to a radiant attack and then a toxic attack.
2) *A deathly chill pervades the area of the breath weapon's area and reaches out 10 yards in all directions from it, lasting 1d4+6 rounds*. Anything in the area at the time the breath weapon is exhaled and anything which starts and ends a round in it is subject to a cold attack.  
The filainarillar may opt to spend any number of phases continuing to exhale the breath weapon, expending any actions during appropriate phases and being unable to perform any reactions while doing so. It can still move during the appropriate phases.  

Once finished with it, the filainarillar rolls a number of d20s to datermine how long must pass before it may perform its breath weapon again equal to the number of phases it used the breath weapon. Each odd result is measured in hours, while each even result is measured in minutes.

**Bravery**: The fillainarillar rolls an additional d6 on all saves against fear based effects.
