### MOUNTAIN LURKER
Though related, these creatures are often mistaken for dragons. They are sometimes called mountain devils. They subsist on gold ores, but will glady eat the pure stuff. They need only an ounce of gold a day, but often fill their diets with a combination of gemstone ores and proteins. They produce large netwroks of caverns in the mountains and below, filling them with chambers as they mine. A mountain lurker does not need to breathe, but is capable of smelling and detecting oxygen, which is needed for its breath weapon. Their collective noun is a Hive.

**Wrestler**: The mountain lurker is proficienct in the wrestling skill.

**Sharp Sniffer**: Mountain lurker's have a +3 to all checks and saves involving their keen sense of smell.

**Breath Weapon**: Mountain lurkers are capable of exhaling a line of flames, as an action. The line is 9 yards in length and is half a foot high and wide. Anything caught within the line suffers a Fire attack. It may do so once per encounter and an additional time between full rests.  
Alternatively, it may cause the breath weapon to take the form of a cone. Doing so reduces the length to one third of its usual length as it sweeps its head side to side.
