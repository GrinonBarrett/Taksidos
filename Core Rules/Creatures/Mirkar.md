**Mighty Slam**: When the mirkar successfully strikes a foe with its slam attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the mirkar knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the mirkar's weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the mirkar had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

**Menacing Growl**: Once per encounter, as an action, anything which can hear the mirkar must succeed a [Will] save with a DV equal to the mirkar's [Empy] score + [Will] bonus or be deathly afraid of it. A critical failure forces a creature to be stunned with fear for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure, causing them to be dazed and vulnerable during this time. The mirkar may use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the save of a creature it can perceive.

**Vanishing into Trees**: When the mirkar's movement would allow it to enter the space of a tree if said tree were not itself an obstacle, *it passes through the tree and exits through another tree it perceived during the same round*. It must complete a full rest before doing so again.
