### Graugolaug
Sometimes, an adventurer needs a horse. Overtime, across many adventures, they form a deep bond together. Sometimes still, such a pair finds themselves in a fit of desperation. If an adventurer opts to kill and eat their companion, they are cursed to hunger for the flesh of other such beasts. They transform into a hideous monster, their limbs becoming clawed legs as their body contorts. Their head elongates, with a jaw like a crocodile. It has ears like a bat and a slender lupine form. They dislike mucous and creatures which produce it.

**Wrestler**: The graugolaug has the Wrestling skill.

**Rake**: As a reaction, if the graugolaug successfully grapples a creature of equal size or no more than 1 size category larger or smaller, it can use its rear claws to inflict a cutting attack each. If it is grappling a creature within those size limits, it may also perform those claw attacks as a single action without penalty for multiple attacks or brawling with the foe.

**Limited Trample**: A graugolaug can trample as though it were a mount, in place of brawling, if it makes contact as a result of sprinting. If it tramples this way, the attack inflicted is a cutting attack. Additionally, if it slams a foe, it inflicts an unarmed attack against that foe.

**Alacrity**: When rolling for initiative, the graugolaug may use its reaction to move a number of feet equal to its result- so long as it does not exceed the appropriate mode of movement. It decides this after turn order is determined, but before actions are taken.

**Startling Speed**: Once per encounter, as an action or reaction, the graugolaug may perform a movement.

**Terrifying Leap**: Once per encounter, the canucorryngraugolaug may quadruple its leap distance.
