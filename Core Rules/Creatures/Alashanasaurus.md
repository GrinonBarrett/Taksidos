**Mighty Slam**: When the alashanasaurus successfully strikes a foe with its slam attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the alashanasaurus knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the alashanasaurs' weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the alashanasaurus had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.
