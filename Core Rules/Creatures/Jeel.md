### Astargel
When star jelly is left undisturbed in a place of great magic, it will begin to form a silvery white blob. This blob will travel around and seek out sources of magic. As it absorbs the magical energy, it will grow in size- causing a nuissance in many places. Their collective noun is a gelling.

**Creature Type**: AStergels are Infigura.

**Size**: Astergels can be from 3" to 3' tall and twice as long. They can weigh up to 12 pounds. They can be diminutive or small creatures.

**Languages**: Astergels don't speak.

#### Special Features 

**Amorphous**: Jeels don’t retain a single cohesive shape but are instead in the form of a glob of gooey material. This confers some strange properties to it.  
 • Immunity to falling and knockback damage.  
 • Obstacles that would reduce the speed of it have only half of their normal effect unless they specifically affect amorphous creatures as well.  
 • All forms of non-magical attack against it have disadvantage.  
 • Anytime a spell would be cast against it that would affect its form, shape, composition, or mental state- it gains a d12 bonus to its saves against that effect.  
 • It cannot be grappled.  
 • While it has a creature grappled, it can treat that creature as being unarmored for the purpose of attacking it.  
 • It is capable of traveling through any opening small enough to stick one’s fist.  
 • Cannot use armor, shields, or any item.   
 • Receives wounds, but no effect from them.

 **Infigural Nature**: Being infigura, jeels have several advantages.  
 • Immunity to all poisons and diseases, including toxic damage, except those that specifically affect infigura. Magic attacks are not affected by this.  
 • Immunity to the effects of bloodloss.  
 • Immunity to fatigue from outside sources.  
 • Immunity to sleep.  
 • Immunity to effects which cause asphyxiation.  
 • Immunity to effects which would inflict the prone condition, unless it specifically targets infigura.  
 • Does not require sleep to rest, but must still manage to relax and unwind as other creatures would.  
 • Immunity to incapacitation, but is destroyed when wounded with no remaining hitpoints.

**Minimal Sensing**: It is, in the most technical sense, blind. It is also devoid of the senses of smell and hearing. Instead it relies on sensing vibrations and its ability to taste everything it comes in contact with. Anytime it would attempt a check or save based on perceiving something, it has disadvantage (likewise, it should get advantage against illusions based on such stimuli). If it would rely on multiple missing senses, it suffers an additional -2 penalty for each total sense. If it is touching or tasting something, it does not have any issues identifying it.

**Mindless**: Jeels do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing effects and fear-based effects.

**Acidic Form**: At the end of every second round the jeel grapples a creature, it inflicts an acid attack against it. Alternatively it can consume an ounce of material in this time. This is negated in water.

**Momentous Form**: Every size category of the creature above diminutive increases its speed by 1 yard.

#### Distilling a Jeel
It is possible for an alchemist to distill the material of a jeel (living or dead). This requires 24 hours and produces 1 ounce of Sudokahest for every 10 pounds of material, a component of many alchemic agents such as alkahest. More can be made in the same time with enough space and equipment. This can be difficult to ensure as the jeel evaportaes into innert vapor at a rate of 1 pount every 1d12+12 hours.
