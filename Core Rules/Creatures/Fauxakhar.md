**Fiendish Nature**: The fauxakhar's fiendish nature bestows it with a few particular features;  
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • Are not subject to bleeding.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom.  
 • Gains a bonus to all saves equal to current hitpoints.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect the flesh.   
 
**Odd Anatomy**: The fauxakhar can move with no prefence as to orientation, effectively treating itself as having no discernable top or bottom and may hover in any direct it can see. So long as it can see a threat, it is never considered to be attacked from behind or flanked. If it cannot see a threat, it is as being attacked from behind.

**Limited Senses**: The fauxakhar has no sense of smell or taste. It cannot receive stimuli from scents or tastes in any capacity as a result (including illusory effects). It can hear into the ethereal plane while on the material plane (and vice versa).

**Great View**: The fauxakhar's eyes each provide a full hemispherical view.

**Basic Eye Beams**: As an action or reaction, one of its eyes may fire a ray like that of a wand at a foe it perceives. This is a ki attack. Each eye may only perform one such attack each round, and only one at a time. These beams suffer no penalty to attacks for brawling.

**Alternative Eye Beams**: Once per round, *the fauxakhar may alter the damage type of one of its eye beams to be fire, necrotic, psychic, or toxic. It cannot change a ray's attack to the same type as it did during the previous round if at all*.

**Piercing Stare**: As an action, the fauxakharkhar fires a basic eyebeam from each of its eyes at the same time at a single target. *It may treat any of the beams as piercing attacks for this purpose*. It must rest before doing so again.

**False beams**: As an action, it fires a beam of illusory power from each eye at a different target. *A creature so targeted must succeed a [Will] or [Prcp] save. If it fails, its hitpoints are reduced by 1. If it is a critical failure, it becomes prone and vulnerable until the end of the round*. It cannot do so during consecutive rounds. A critical success on the save reveals the nature of the attack to the creature, and it ceases to be affected by it for the rest of the encounter. A creature with no hitpoints remaining suffers no effect from this.

**Infernal Regeneration**: At the end of any round the fauxakhar receives a wound and has any hitpoints remaining, it may use its reaction to roll a d8 and compare it to its current hitpoints. If the result is lower, it recovers a single hitpoint. It must perform a rest before doing so again.

**Draining Probiscus**: Anytime the fauxakhar's probiscus inflicts a critical hit or would qualify to damage a foe's armor, it may inflict a level of fatigue against that creature. If it receives fatigue this way, the fauxakhar may choose to either reduce its own fatigue by 1 level or recover 1d2-1 hitpoints.

**Triplicate**: As an action, *the fauxakhar creatures two illusory entities that appear exactly it does. They spawn within 3 yards. These entities have no hitpoints, retain the fauxakhar's hover speed, have the Fauxakhar's False Beams feature, have no senses, and cannot physically interact with anything. Any attack roll of 9 or greater will destroy it, as will anything requireing it to make a save*. They cannot act independently, instead receiving psychic commands from their originating Fauxakhar- which demands its concentration to maintain.

**Triplipace**: *Its hover speed is tripled*.

**Weak**: The fauxakhar's weight load limits are halved.
