### Gliterenar

**Wyrding**: The gliterenar is capable of casting spells by wyrding. They know the following spells (Alacering, Fetch, Feyding Gesture, Glitter, Grasp, Jinx, Seclusion Circle).

**Bag of Glitter**: The gliterenar keeps a sack of powdered glass and metal. It can, as an action, throw a handful of it out in a .5 yard cone. Anything within the cone must succeed a [Rflx] save with a DV of 15 or be temporarily blinded by the mixture until it can be washed out. A creature may use its reaction to gain advantage on this save. Despite the addition of glass dust, the glitter is not overtly dangerous. Anyone covered in the glitter suffers a 1d4 penalty to counterspell checks.
