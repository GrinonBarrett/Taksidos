#### Striders of Other Species'
A strider of a species other than manfolk should have their attributes, size, unarmed attacks, and creature type adjusted appropriately- however infigura, ephemera, beasts, and any species with a feature which includes the word "nature" in it should be excluded as these can complicate things a bit. Such a strider still eats, drinks, breathes, etc. as a normal member of that species.
