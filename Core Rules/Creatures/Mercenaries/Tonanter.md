**Lucertolan Education**: It has proficiency in Survival and one other skill.

**Small Frame**: Lucertolans can use most equipment just fine, but armor must be made especially for them. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for a lucertolan cost half again as it would typically and weighs two thirds what it would normally.

**Weak**: The lucertolan's weight capacity is reduced to ½ at all load levels.

**Thermal Regulation**: So long as it would not deal damage to it, it is comfortable in any temperature.

**Longbreath**: A tonanter may hold their breath for double the usual time.
