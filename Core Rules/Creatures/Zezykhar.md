**Breathless**: The zezykhar does not need to breathe or eat. It does still sleep.

**Odd Anatomy**: The zezykhar can move with no prefence as to orientation, effectively treating itself as having no discernable top or bottom and may hover in any direct it can see. So long as it can see a threat, it is never considered to be attacked from behind or flanked. If it cannot see a threat, it is as being attacked from behind.

**Limited Senses**: The zezykhar has no sense of smell, taste, or proper hearing. It cannot receive stimuli from scents, tastes, or sounds in any capacity as a result (including illusory effects). It can see into the ethereal plane while on the material plane (and vice versa).

**Great View**: The zezykhar's eyes each provide a full hemispherical view.

**Sweet Sound**: As an action, the zezykhar can produce a sound that is apealing to beasts, humanoids, and sylvan creatures. Each such creature within 100 yards which can hear must succeed an [Inte] save with a DV of 13 or investigate the sound. A critcal failure will daze the creature for a number of phases equal to the points of failure. A success results in the sound being dismissed. A critical success results in the listener recognizing it as some very unnatural sound and knowing the direction it came from. It must rest before using this feature again.

**Scrambled Wave**: As an action, it produces a variety of frequencies which are harmful to the function of many processes. Any creature within 25 yards which can hear it is subject to a sonic attack. It must rest before doing so again.

**Basic Eye Beams**: As an action or reaction, one of its eyes may fire a ray like that of a wand at a foe it perceives. This is a ki attack. Each eye may only perform one such attack each round, and only one at a time. These beams suffer no penalty to attacks for brawling.

**Alternative Eye Beams**: Once per round, *the zezykhar may alter the damage type of one of its eye beams to be necrotic, psychic, sonic, or radiant. It cannot change a ray's attack to the same type as it did during the previous round if at all*.

**Triple Beam**: As an action, the zezykhar fires a basic eyebeam from each of its eyes at the same time. It must rest before doing so again.

**Spinning Trick**: When it would move, if it is not restrained or immobile, *it may use its reaction to instead fire beams from each of its eyes and spin rapidly- inflict an attack in all 360 degrees. This is a radiant attack. It must rest before doing so again. If it is missing an eye when it does so, it becomes dazed until the end of the next round. If it was mising two eyes, it is also vulnerable during this time. The attacks get a -1 for each missing eye*.

**Triplipace**: *Its levitation speed is tripled*.

**Focus Antennae**: As an action, it may grant itself the ability to hear until the end of the round.

**Weak**: The zezykhar's weight load limits are halved.
