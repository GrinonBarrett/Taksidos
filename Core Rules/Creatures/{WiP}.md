**Shadowy**: Moritithi are creatures of shadow and as a result possess a few traits which make them difficult to deal with;    
The moritith exists where the light does not touch, this means they may only exist in a constant state of darkness.  
 • So long as it does not end the round in it, the moritith may use its movement to cross illuminated areas.  
 • Moritithi are unaffected by darkness and can see in it as though it were fair light.  
 • If a moritith is somehow trapped in light, it treats bright light as most creatures would treat darkness. It treats fair and dim light as most creatures would treat dim light. It will also become dazed while it is trapped in the light.   
 • Non-magical forms of damage have no effect on the moritith.  
 • The moritith cannot be grappled, restrained, or made prone by any non-magical means.  
 • The moritith ignores all ethereal/material armor when attacking a creature which is in dim light or no light at all using its unarmed attack.  
 • A moritith ignores a target’s cover from objects when it strikes a foe with its unarmed attack.  
 • Moritithi make no sound when they move.  
 • Moritithi cast no shadow or reflection when observed.  
 • Moritithi do not need to eat or drink.  
 • Moritithi only gain a full or long rest's benefits if they use their Maring feature against another creature.  
 • You cannot wear armor.  
 • You have a Attack versus Creature table which outlines your defense against each kind of attack.  
 • Immunity to damage from falling and knockback.  
 • Immunity to all poisons, venom, and diseases.  
 • Immunity to the effects of bloodloss.  
 • Immunity to effects that affect flesh.  
 • Immunity to fatigue except as a cost to use class features, actions, or magic items.  
 • Immunity to sleep.  
 • Immunity to effects which cause asphyxiation.  
 • Immunity to incapacitation. Instead you can be destroyed as outlined below.  
 • Choose a metal. You cannot purposefully come in contact with that metal and will immediately know if it is the appropriate metal as soon as you can perceive it. Any attack made by an item made from the metal gets a % bonus against you equal to its $ value per pound. Any contact with the chosen metal (uncluding being struck) eaves you vulnerable until at least two whole rounds have passed since you came in contact with it. You cannot perform wyrdings during this time.  
 • A weapon which is illuminated in some way gains advantage on attacks against you. Treat a lit torch as an illuminated club.  
 • Damage from radiant sources reduces the maximum hitpoints of a moritith rather than dealing damage. The dusken regains 1 of these per a short rest, 3 per a long rest, and all per a full rest.
