### Drakon
A serpentine beast which trades a traditional head for a large eye. The tail features a tiny mouth and can breath fire. It can potentially shoot a venomous liquid from its eye ducts. The "heads" are really just glorified eyestalks. It consumes its food using the tail. Its center of mass contains all vital organs including its central brain, but each of its heads contains a small brain-like organ that aids the processing of visual information. Their collective noun is a stare.

**Mighty Slam**: When the drakon successfully strikes a foe with its slam or tail attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the drakon knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the drakon's weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the drakon had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

**Replacing Heads**: If the drakon's head is removed- it does not perish. Instead, it will grow 2 new heads. These finish forming 1d6+1 rounds after the head is lost (roll sepertely for each). If the stump is scarred by acid, fire, or necrotic damage (or some other means of shaping flesh) before a new head can grow, it can prevent this.

**Super Eyes**: Each of the eyes is capable of moving independently. Each eye is capable of detecting magic with its gaze. It is also capable of seeing a broader spectrum than the human eye (330-870 nm) due to their pentachroma, allowing it to see into the infrared. Furthermore, it is capable of seeing into the psychic and ethereal planes. Additionally, each eye is capable of two attacks, a toxic spurt and a ray.

**Toxic Spurt**: The fluid used to keep the eye moist can be propelled from the fluid sack once per encounter. This is an unarmed ranged acid attack.

**Ray**: Once per encounter, for each eye, it can produce a ray attack. In place of rolling a d20, it rolls 1d8+1d10. The attack type is determined by the d8 result;
1. Force
2. Fire
3. Radiant
4. Ki
5. Electrical
6. Ki
7. Sonic
8. Ki

**Multiple Heads**: The drakon gets the following benefits for each head beyond the first it possesses  
* +1 bonus on all [Prcp] checks and saves involving sight.
* +1 to attack rolls using its ray attack.
* +1 bonus to its counterspell checks against foe casting a spell.
* +1 to initiative rolls.

**Fire Jet**: Drakons are capable of propelling a line of flames, as an action, from their tail. The line is 5 yards long and is a quarter foot high and wide. Anything caught within the line suffers a Fire attack. Once it has used this ability, it cannot do so again until if finishes a long or full rest.
