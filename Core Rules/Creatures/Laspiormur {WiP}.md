### Laspiormur
A creature which appears to have a body of jelly, but is capable of hardening or relaxing the density at will. It is farily mindless, hunting by instinct, but has a habit of surprising adventurers nonetheless. Their collective noun is an infestation.

**Size**: Laspiormurs can be from 3.5 to 8 yards in length. They can weigh between 60-240 pounds. They are medium creatures.

#### Special Features 

**Amorphous**: Laspiormurs don’t retain a detailed cohesive shape but are instead a vaguely cy;indrical mass of gooey material. This confers some strange properties to it.  
 • Immunity to falling and knockback damage.  
 • Obstacles that would reduce the speed of it have only half of their normal effect unless they specifically affect amorphous creatures as well.  
 • All forms of non-magical attack against it have disadvantage.  
 • Anytime a spell would be cast against it that would affect its form, shape, composition, or mental state- it gains a d12 bonus to its saves against that effect.  
 • It cannot be grappled.  
 • While it has a creature grappled, it can treat that creature as being unarmored for the purpose of attacking it.  
 • It is capable of traveling through any opening small enough to stick a growwn man's waist.
 • Cannot use armor, shields, or any item.   
 • Receives wounds, but no effect from them.

 **Infigural Nature**: Being infigura, laspiormurs have several advantages.  
 • Immunity to all poisons and diseases, including toxic damage, except those that specifically affect infigura. Magic attacks are not affected by this.  
 • Immunity to the effects of bloodloss.  
 • Immunity to fatigue from outside sources.  
 • Immunity to sleep.  
 • Immunity to effects which cause asphyxiation.  
 • Immunity to effects which would inflict the prone condition, unless it specifically targets infigura.  
 • Does not require sleep to rest, but must still manage to relax and unwind as other creatures would.  
 • Immunity to incapacitation, but is destroyed when wounded with no remaining hitpoints.

**Minimal Sensing**: It is, in the most technical sense, blind. It is also devoid of the senses of smell and hearing. Instead it relies on sensing vibrations and its ability to taste everything it comes in contact with. Anytime it would attempt a check or save based on perceiving something, it has disadvantage (likewise, it should get advantage against illusions based on such stimuli). If it would rely on multiple missing senses, it suffers an additional -2 penalty for each total sense. If it is touching or tasting something, it does not have any issues identifying it.

**Electrosensing**: Laspiormurs

**Mindless**: Jeels do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing effects and fear-based effects.

**Acidic Form**: At the end of every round the jeel grapples a creature, it inflicts an acid attack against it. Alternatively it can consume an ounce of material in this time. This is negated in water.

**Flexirigidity**: If it is not prone, the laspiormur may treat its Slam attack as inflicting a force attack.

**Mighty Slam**: When the brachiosaurus successfully strikes a foe with its slam attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the laspiormur knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the laspiormur's weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the laspiormur had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

#### Distilling a Jeel
It is possible for an alchemist to distill the material of a jeel (living or dead). This requires 24 hours and produces 1 ounce of Sudokahest for every 10 pounds of material, a component of many alchemic agents such as alkahest. More can be made in the same time with enough space and equipment. This can be difficult to ensure as the jeel evaportaes into innert vapor at a rate of 1 pount every 1d12+12 hours.
