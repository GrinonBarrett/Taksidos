#### Variants
Among the bogkin people, there are a few standouts. 

**Bogkin Bogriner**: Some say they are witches, others say they are diviners, and some claim them mediators of magical contracts. Bogriners are capable of performing magic. They typically know the following spells: _Animation_, _Intoxify_, _Rotward_, _Silent Alarm_, _Wretched Ray_, and two more spells. They are also proficient with clubs, daggers, slings, and staves.  
Bogriners are more apt to do business with adventurers than most bogkin, but can be tricky to deal with.

#### Special Features

**Show of Strength**: When the bogkin would gain a bonus to their melee attack due to having a higher [Body] score, they may choose to replace their +1 bonus to the attack with a bonus equal to their [Body] bonus. If they do, their foe adds their [Body] bonus to their defense.

**Bogkin Resilience**: Bogkin double their attribute bonus on all [Fort] and [Inte] saves against magical effects.
