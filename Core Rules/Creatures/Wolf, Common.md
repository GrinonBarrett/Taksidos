**Fleet Foot**: During the first round of an encounter, the wolf may use its action to perform a move.

**Swift Step**: If the wolf would gain exhaustion for sprinting because it ran, it may choose simply not to. It must complete a rest before doing so again.

**Tireless Stride**: If it did not sprint during the previous round, and is performing a sprint, it does not incur fatigue.

**Built for Speed**: When sprinting, its run speed is multiplied by the number of sprints it has performed since the start of the previous round.

**Latching Bite**: If the wolf's bite would qualify to damage armor, the foe is grappled.

**Vicious Bite**: As an additional option when it succeeds a critical success while brawling, it may bite the foe whom it is brawling. This is treated as a Biting attack, ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling.
