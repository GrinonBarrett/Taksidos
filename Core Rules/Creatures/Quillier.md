#### Special Features

**Winged Lunge**: As an action or reaction, a mantispidon may push itself away from a surface or object capable of bearing its weight and perform a small burst of flight. It is treated as performing a jump, with the maximum height and distance doubled. This movement does not count against its limitation on flying in the round.

**Rapid Striker**: The mantispidon does not have disadvantage on follow up attacks.
