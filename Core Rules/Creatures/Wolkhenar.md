**Nimble Flight**: While flying, the wolkhenar adds its [Rflx] bonus to its defense against all attacks made at a range of 5 yards or greater. It does not gain this benefit while prone.

**Travel by Lightning**: As an action, *it can summon forth a lightning bolt from an overhead cloud to strike it. This will occur during the following movement step. As its action during the following action phase, a new lightning bolt will strike a point within 50 yards, and the wolkhenar will appear there. It may strike a creature this way, inflicting an electrical attack against it and initiating a brawl if able*. It incurs a point of spell sickness when it does so. It cannot do so if its current spell sickness + current wounds is equal to or greater than its [Fort] score.

**Breath Weapon**: The wolkenar may loose a blast of charged elemental energy exhaled as an action. This is treated as the ray of a wand attack. If the attack roll result is even, it is cold. If odd, it is electrical. *If it is a critcal hit, it also inflicts the effect of a radiant critical hit*. It must complete a rest before doing so again.

**Cloud Living**: A wolkhenar is *always affected as though by a Synnefopothy spell*. If this magic would be dispelled, it takes 1d6+4 rounds for it to actually affect the wolkhenar's ability to interact with clouds specifically.

**Dive**: If the wolkhenar flies at least 20 yards in the previous round, it gets a bnus on its first attack made before the primary movement phase of the current round. This bonus is equal to one-tenth of the total yards moved since the beginning of the previous round.
