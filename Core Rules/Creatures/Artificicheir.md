**Body of Arcane Force**: Artificicheirs are made a mobile form of forcefield. As such they   
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom including toxic damage.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh or physically manipulate them.    
 • Cannot be healed.  
 • Have advantage on saves against effects which would grapple, restrain, or make them prone.
 • Cease to exist upon entering an area that supresses magic.
 • Is destroyed if an attack is successful against it while it has no remaining hitpoints.
 • Is not automatically destroyed by a disimpress spell if it has any remaining hitpoints, but does lose hitpoints equal to the tier of that spell instead.

**Forceful Strike**: Anytime the artificicheir's unarmed attack is a critical hit, it may shove that creature.

**Senseless**: Artificicheirs do not receive stimuli form any senses.

**Mindless**: Artificicheirs do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing effects and fear-based effects.

**Controlled Force**: Everything an artificicheir does is the direct result of the psychic commands of what created it. This demands the concentration of whatever creature is to "operate" it. If the concentration is broken- it stops acting in any way. The operator must be able to perceive the artificicheir to concentrate on it.

**Variable Size**: Because these are created as the result of a spell, they can be of a variable size. The features presented here are for a default small sized hand. If created by a spell (or other magical effect) of a higher tier than first, use the modifications as directed by the following table.  
| Size | [Body] score and bonus | Weight | Hover Speed | Hitpoints | Additional Tiers Required |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| | | | | | |
| Insurmountable | 30 (+10) | 4,500 lbs | 1,000 yards | 7 | +12 |
| Jormungous | 29 (+9) | 3,000 lbs | 500 yards | 7 | +9 |
| Titanous | 28 (+9) | 2,000 lbs | 100 yards | 7 | +7 |
| Big | 27 (+9) | 1,000 lbs | 75 yards | 6 | +5 |
| Huge | 24 (+8) | 500 lbs | 40 yards | 5 | +4 |
| Great | 21 (+7) | 200 lbs | 25 yards | 4 | +3 |
| Large | 18 (+6) | 100 lbs | 9 yards | 3 | +2 |
| Medium | 15 (+5) | 50 lbs | 7 yards | 2 | +1 |
