**Supernatural Haste**: *The windrunner gains a 2d4+2 bonus to initiative. During the first round of an encounter, it may perform an additional reaction*.

**Swift Step**: If it would gain exhaustion for sprinting because it ran, it may choose simply not to. It must complete a rest before doing so again.

**Tireless Stride**: If it did not sprint during the previous round, and is performing a sprint, it does not incur fatigue.

**Built for Speed**: When sprinting, its run speed is multiplied by the number of sprints it has performed since the start of the previous round.

**Latching Bite**: If the windrunner's bite would qualify to damage armor, the foe is grappled.

**Vicious Bite**: As an additional option when it succeeds a critical success while brawling, it may bite the foe whom it is brawling. This is treated as a Biting attack, ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling.

**Skywalking**: The windrunner is capable of using its run speed to traverse through the air so long as it moves at least 5 yards during each move phase.

**Gliding**: The windrunner falls at 1/4 the normal speed and can move forward while doing so.

**Breath Weapon**: The windrunner can exhale a cone of gas in a 7 yard cone which inflicts a cold attack as an action. It inflicts the critical hit of a toxic attack. It must complete a long or full rest before doing so again.

**Limited Spell Casting**: The windrunner is capable of casting the following spells (Call lightning, Frostbite, Volt Switch, Wisp Away) as though it were capable of wyrding. It will not do so if alone in a fight or it has any spell sickness.
