### Arbreberakhor
Magical insects which grow to strange sizes. Each segment of their body appears to be a swirl of pastel colors and each ot their six legs is an individual primary or secondary color. Their violet eyes appear as another color to any creature with more than 3 chroma. They hunt in packs but are not as territorial as would be expected of such a creature. They favor 2 to 1 odds when attacking and debilitate the senses of their prey quickly to enable mass attack. The collective noun is a blur.

#### Special Features

**Bode Resistance**: Anytime the arbreberakhor is attacked by a ray, like that of a wand, or a magical radiant attack- it may use its reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack.

**Web**: The arbreberakhor is capable of producing up to 3 yards of web a day. This web functions as rope with a weight of .2 pound per yard and strength 400. *The web is resistant to natural degradation*.

**Spectral Burst**: The arbreberakhor can cast wyrdings, but only knows the Spectral Busrt spell.

**Innate Light**: *The arbreberakhor emits light like a torch, but cannot see the light it produces itself*.

**Brilliant Reappearance**: The arbreberakhor may move itself instantly a number of yards equal to its [Will] score. When it reappeara, it produces a radiant attack against anything within 5 yards as a flash of flight bursts from their destination. This attack does not wound, and instead blinds a creature for a number of rounds equal to the points of success. It must rest before doing so again.
