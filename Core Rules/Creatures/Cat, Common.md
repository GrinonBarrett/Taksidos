#### Gaining a Cat Servile

An invoker which has earned the trust of a cat can simply entreat it into their serivce as a lesser servile. When entreated into service this way, it is treated as having a single hitpoint.

**Dominion Benefits**: The cat gains the benefit as appropriate to your domain.  
* **Chosen Spirit**. The cat can become ethereal as an action. When it does so, it can expend an action to return to the material plane. Each of these fuctions can be done only once between rests.
* **The Earth**. The cat is immune to damage from falling so long as it is not prone or immobile.
* **The Flame**. The cat is immune to non-magical fire and cannot be frozen by magical means.
* **The Grave**. Undead creatures fear the cat. An undead creature that notices the cat must succeed a [Will] save with a DV equal to its [Will] + the invoker's [Empy] bonus or attempt to flee from its sight. A critical success makes a creature immune to the same cat's sight. A critical failure leaves a creatures dazed.
* **The Light**: It treats darkness as though it were dim light.
* **Nobility**. If the cat dodges an attack and it is a failure in any degree, it does not count against the cat's reaction for the round.
* **The Sea**. Its swim speed is increased by 2 yards.
* **The Sky**. The cat is capable of casting the *Landing* spell, as though it could wyrd. It cannot do so if its spell sickness is equal to or greater than invoker's conjury.
* **Valdercaller**. Its unarmed attacks, upon inflicting a critical hit, also inflict a toxic attack.
