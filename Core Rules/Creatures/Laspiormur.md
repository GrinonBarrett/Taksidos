### Laspiormur
A creature which appears to have a body of jelly, but is capable of hardening or relaxing the density at will. It is farily mindless, hunting by instinct, but has a habit of surprising adventurers nonetheless. It sustains itself by dissolving organic material. It could survive on just plants, but has evolved to predate on animals. In the wild, it usually remains calm until potential prey nears, rushes at max speed, and attempts to slam it. During lengthier confrontations, it will swim/burrow to attack from another angle. Their collective noun is an infestation.

**Creature Type**: Laspiormurs are Infigura.

**Size**: Laspiormurs can be from 3.5 to 8 yards in length. They can weigh between 60-240 pounds. They are medium creatures.

**Languages**: Laspiormurs don't speak.

#### Special Features 

**Amorphous**: Laspiormurs don’t retain a detailed cohesive shape but are instead a vaguely cy;indrical mass of gooey material. This confers some strange properties to it.  
 • Immunity to falling and knockback damage.  
 • Obstacles that would reduce the speed of it have only half of their normal effect unless they specifically affect amorphous creatures as well.  
 • All forms of non-magical attack against it have disadvantage.  
 • Anytime a spell would be cast against it that would affect its form, shape, composition, or mental state- it gains a 2d8 bonus to its saves against that effect.  
 • It cannot be grappled.  
 • While it has a creature grappled, it can treat that creature as being unarmored for the purpose of attacking it.  
 • It is capable of traveling through any opening small enough to stick a growwn man's waist.
 • Cannot use armor, shields, or any item.   
 • Receives wounds, but no effect from them.

 **Infigural Nature**: Being infigura, laspiormurs have several advantages.  
 • Immunity to all poisons and diseases, including toxic damage, except those that specifically affect infigura. Magic attacks are not affected by this.  
 • Immunity to the effects of bloodloss.  
 • Immunity to fatigue from outside sources.  
 • Immunity to sleep.  
 • Immunity to effects which cause asphyxiation.  
 • Immunity to effects which would inflict the prone condition, unless it specifically targets infigura.  
 • Does not require sleep to rest, but must still manage to relax and unwind as other creatures would.  
 • Immunity to incapacitation, but is destroyed when wounded with no remaining hitpoints.

**Minimal Sensing**: It is, in the most technical sense, blind. It is also devoid of the senses of smell and hearing. Instead it relies on sensing vibrations and its ability to taste everything it comes in contact with. Anytime it would attempt a check or save based on perceiving something, it has disadvantage (likewise, it should get advantage against illusions based on such stimuli). If it would rely on multiple missing senses, it suffers an additional -2 penalty for each total sense. If it is touching or tasting something, it does not have any issues identifying it.

**Electrosensing**: Laspiormurs can sense the electrical impulses of most non-mindless and non-monster creatures within 40 yards. This range is halved underwater and is negligible while burrowing. It can also detect a creature that has been successfully struck by an electrical attack within a number of yards equal to the attack roll total until the end of the next round.

**Tremor Sense**: It is able to sense vibrations in the ground and objects it touches. This essentially allows it to sense, through touch, anything moving on the same ground as it within 20 yards and anything touching the same object as it.

**Mindless**: Laspiormurs do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing effects and fear-based effects.

**Acidic Form**: At the end of every round the laspiormur grapples a creature, it inflicts an acid attack against it. Alternatively it can consume an pound of material in this time. This is negated in petroleum-based substances, the fatty oil extracted from plants, or rendered animal fats.

**Flexirigidity**: If it is not prone or vulnerable, the laspiormur may treat its Slam attack as inflicting a force attack. Additionally, it is treated as having an additional +3 [Body] and [Rflx] (increasing the respective bonuses by +1).

**Tunneling Leap**: If the laspiormur uses both of its movements to burrow during the round and it has sprinted to burrow, it can propel itself through the air if it surfaces. It launches itself 1d6 + [Body] bonus yards into the air when it does so.

**Rush Through**: The laspiormur is able to trample as though it were a mount. Additionally, if it tramples acreature with less [Body] than itself, it also inflicts a force attack against it.

**Mighty Slam**: When the laspiormur successfully strikes a foe with its slam attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the laspiormur knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the laspiormur's weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the laspiormur had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.
