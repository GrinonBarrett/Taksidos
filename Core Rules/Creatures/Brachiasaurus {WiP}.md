Godly Strength: Anytime the brachiosaurus would
roll a number of [Body] dice, it rolls twice as many
dice.
Unwieldy Gait: When prone, the dinosaur must
spend a total of 15 moves/actions to correct itself.
Its speed is instead quartered and its penalties to
[Rβlx] and [Body] checks and saves is applied to
each attribute die rolled.
Bulk: The brachiosaurus is capable of using its
[Body] for defense against attacks it is aware of to
represent its resilience. Additionally, anytime the
narrator deems its physicality would be a factor in
defense, it gains +2 defense and 2 SP against that
attack.
Due to the Godly Strength, the dinosaur will roll two
[Body] dice when applying it to its defense.
Sheer Force: A creature struck by the
brachiosaurus’ slam attack must succeed a
Gymnastics [Body] save with a DV equal to the

damage received plus the dinosaur’s [Body] or be
knocked back a number of half-meters equal to the
points of failure. If the result was a critical failure,
the creature is also knocked prone. Due to the Godly
Strength, the dinosaur will roll two [Body] dice
when determining that factor of the DV.
Slam: The brachiasaurus is capable of using nearly
any part of its body as to attack a foe. They use the
[Body] attribute and are not considered unarmed
attacks. On a critical hit, the brachiosaurus rolls a
[Body] die and applies the result as additional
damage. Damage is force. Due to the Godly Strength,
the brachiosaurus will roll an additional two dice
when performing the attack and an additional die
upon a critical hit.

Combat

Brachiosaurus do not typically engage in combat.
They are not territorial and have few natural
predators capable of bringing them down. In
combat, they will snap their massive tail at an
offender, usually dictating the βight in that single
act. They do not care for βlashy magic. If they notice
something man sized and magical,they will attempt to trample it.

**Mighty Slam**: When the alashanasaurus successfully strikes a foe with its slam attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the alashanasaurus knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the alashanasaurs' weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the alashanasaurus had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.
