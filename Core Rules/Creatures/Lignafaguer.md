### Lignafaguer
A rare creature found in dungeons and in some eastern ruins. Such a creature sustains itself on non-living wood. Despite this, they typically avoid villages due to the threat its inhabitants pose. They can be found occasionally on wooded routes, consuming broken down and abandoned wagons. Despite their fearsome appearence at first glance, they are functionally scavengers in the ecosystem. They can be warded by silver, and is is said that wood sealed with silver dust is safe from their appetite. They have a chonky body with six "legs" protuding out in a circle around their midsection. Their six "legs" are actually strikers they can use to run and climb. The plural is Lignafageim. Their collective noun is a cast.
