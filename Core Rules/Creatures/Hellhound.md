**Fiendish Nature**: The hellhound's fiendish nature bestows it with a few particular features;  
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • Are not subject to bleeding.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom.  
 • Gains a bonus to all saves equal to current hitpoints.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect the flesh.   

**Frightening Howl**: During the first round of an encounter, the hellhound may use its reaction to loose a howl that can shake any hero. All non-fiends within 25 yards that can hear the hellhound must succeed a DV 19 [Will] save or flee in terror by every possible means from the hell hound for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. If a creature's save was a critical failure, it is also vulnerable during this time. A critical success will make it forever immune to that same hellhound's frightening howl and allow it to recognise it in the future.

**Swift Step**: If the hellhound would gain exhaustion for sprinting because it ran, it may choose simply not to. It must complete a rest before doing so again.

**Tireless Stride**: If it did not sprint during the previous round, and is performing a sprint, it does not incur fatigue.

**Built for Speed**: When sprinting, its run speed is multiplied by the number of sprints it has performed since the start of the previous round.

**Vicious Bite**: As an additional option when it succeeds a critical success while brawling, it may bite the foe whom it is brawling. This is treated as a Biting attack, ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling.

**Hellfire Presence**: Anytime the hellhound scores a critical hit with an unarmed attack against a creature, its unarmed attack would qualify to damage armor against a creature, or that creature's melee attack would qualify to damage armor against the hellhound- a *magical fire attack is inflicted against that creature*.

**Horrid Mauling**: If the hellhound's unarmed attack against a foe it is brawling with or grappled is successful, it also *inflicts a magical attack against that foe. If the attack roll is even, it is fire. If it is odd, it is psychic*.

**Infernal Regeneration**: At the end of any round the hellhound receives a wound and has any hitpoints remaining, it may use its reaction to roll a d8 and compare it to its current hitpoints. If the result is lower, it recovers a single hitpoint. It must perform a rest before doing so again.

**Breath Weapon**: Once per encounter, the hellhound may exhale a 10 yard cone which inflicts a fire attack, a *magical ki attack*, and a *magical necrotic attack* as an action.
