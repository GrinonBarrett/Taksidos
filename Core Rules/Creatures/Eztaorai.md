### Eztaorai
These four winged monsters appear to have a frame like a pteransaurid. They possess seven slender tails which each bear a small plume of colorful feathers to adorn their otherwise drab coloration. They are opportunist predators that aren't above scavenging a corpse from another's hunt. The plume of their tails hides a paralytic venom they use to escape from predators, but not for hunting. They are rarely seen in groups larger than 5 but are equally likely to be solitary hunters. The plural is Eztaoroi. Their collective noun is a Spry.

**Creature Type**: Eztaoroi are Avian.

**Size**: Eztaoroi tend to be between 7' to 8' in length, not including an additional yard for their tails. Their wingspan is 20-22.5 feet. They stand about 15' tall when standing on their wings as strikers, but spend most of their time on the ground laying down and resting. They weigh 55-68 pounds. They are medium creatures.

**Hitpoints**: An eztaorai has a single hitpoint.

**Nimble Flight**: While flying, the eztaorai adds its [Rflx] bonus to its defense against all attacks made at a range of 5 yards or greater. It does not gain this benefit while prone.

**Terrifying Leap**: Once per encounter, it may quadruple its leap distance.

**Plume Venom**: If the eztaorai's tail attack is successful, the afflicted creature becomes prone at the end of the round. This lasts for 2d6+8 minutes. Additionally, at the end of the round following its becoming prone, it must succeed a [Fort] save with a DV of 16 or take seizures which halve its speed and make it vulnerable. This lasts for the remainder of the time the venom affects it. Multiple instances of the venom do not produce multiple instances of the effect, but do cause a new [Fort] save to be performed with a penalty equal to the total and reset the duration of the venom (roll and use the greatest  of either the remaining time or the newly generated duration). An eztaorai is not immune to such a venom, but gets a +3 bonus to saves against it.

**Additional Limbs**: The eztaorai only needs two of its wings to operate, but gains advantages for devoting all four to flight for the round. Its flight speed is increased by 11 yards if it is not prone. If it uses them as two additional strikers to run, the run speed is increased by 3 yards. It also gains a Climb speed of 1 yard while using four strikers.

**Retractable Membrane**: The eztaorai may cause the mebrane in its wings to retact, allowing it to use the bony frame of the wing as a striker with minimal risk to the wing's capabilities so long as the wing is not wounded. It can strike with each striker individually, but is likely to be using at least two of its wings/strikers to move at any point in time.

**Dive**: If the eztaorai flies at least 20 yards in the previous round, it gets a bonus on its first attack made before the primary movement phase of the current round. This bonus is equal to one-tenth of the total yards moved since the beginning of the previous round.
