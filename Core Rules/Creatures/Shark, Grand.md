**Ocean Breathing Gills**: A shark does not breath air, instead breathing underwater. It must remain in motion to breathe. If it is rendered immobile, it is also dazed and begins asphyxiating. If it is prone, it is also dazed.

**Tireless Stride**: If it did not sprint during the previous round, and is performing a sprint, it does not incur fatigue.

**Built for Speed**: When sprinting, its swim speed is multiplied by the number of sprints it has performed since the start of the previous round.

**Terrible Speed**: As a reaction to itself performing a move, the shark may increase its swim speed to 25 yards.

**Heightened Oralfactory Senses**: It gains a +3 bonus to [Prcp] checks and saves involving scent.

**Lateral Senses**: The shark can "feel" the movement of the water around it. It is considered to have a sense of touch stretching out 1.5 yards so long as something is moving within that distance.

**Latching Bite**: If the shark's bite would qualify to damage armor, the foe is grappled.

**Vicious Bite**: As an additional option when it succeeds a critical success while brawling, it may bite the foe whom it is brawling. This is treated as a Biting attack, ignoring the penalty for the attack while brawling.

**Serrated Teeth**: If a shark's biting attack is a critical success, it also inflicts an unarmed cutting attack against the foe. This cutting attack gains a bonus equal to its [Body] modifier for the purpose of determining a critical hit.  
Additionally, if it has a foe grappled, it may inflict an unarmed cutting attack against that foe as an action or reaction. Such a cutting attack gains a bonus equal to its [Body] bonus if it is higher than the foe's.

**Biting Grasp**: The shark maintains any grapple by biting with its jaw, therefore it has disadvnatage on checks pertaining to maintaining its grapple against a creature during any round it bites.  
Additionally, as a reaction, it may inflict a crushing attack against a creature it has grappled by adjusting the pressure with its grip.

**Swallow Whole**: If the shark successfully grapples a creature of at least 2 categories smaller than itself (such as a small or smaller size), it swallows it whole. A creature may be able to cut its way out or succeed an opposed [Rflx] check using their Wrestling skill to escape.
