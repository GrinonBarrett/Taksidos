**Fiendish Nature**: The flaiskajanter's fiendish nature bestows it with a few particular features;  
 • Do not need to drink, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • Are not subject to bleeding.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom.  
 • Gains a bonus to all saves equal to current hitpoints.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect the flesh.  

**Woundless**: In its natural form, the flaiskajanter does not receive the effects of wounds nor does it roll incapcitation saves when its hitpoints are reduced to 0. It is simply destroyed if damaged with no remaining hitpoints.

**Mimicry**: A flaiskajanter can imitate a sound akin to another creature. Any creature which hears it must make a [Prcp] save with a DV equal to the flaiskajanter's 7 + the flaiskajanter's [Inte] and [Prcp] bonuses or believe the intended creature is making the intended sound. More extreme attempts, such as specific calls of exotic birds or large creatures such as the brachiosaurus are at the narrator’s discretion.

**Infernal Regeneration**: At the end of any round the flaiskajanter loses any hitpoints and has any hitpoints remaining, it may use its reaction to roll a d8 and compare it to its current hitpoints. If the result is lower, it recovers a single hitpoint. It must perform a rest before doing so again.

**Flaisketam**: The flaiskajanter is capable of consuming creatures other than Constructs, Elementals, Ephemera, Eldritches, Fiends, Monsters, and Undead. This can take some time. Presume it can consume about 31 pounds per hour for every hour of the day. Each pound consumed this way is treated as a single serving of food. It requires triple the amount of food of a mount of similar size would require. It leaves the exterior of the creature intact.  
It can eat additional servings of food, which can count towards future hunger.

**Vile Smell**: Any checks made to detect a flaiskajanter by smell gains a 1d8 bonus.

**Assuming Forms**: The flaiskajanter can transform into a creature (or character) it has observed for a total of 2 hours. This requires a whole minute and the exterior remains of the creature. It is vulnerable and immobile during this time. While in the form, it functions identically to a member of that creature's stat block. If a flaiskajanter in an alternative form would fail an incapacitation save in any degree, it will begin changing into its natural form immediately, which will take a number of rounds equal to its current number of wounds. It is vulnerable during this time. If the wyndakhor is made to revert to its natural form this way, it cannot shapeshift until it completes a rest. It can resume its natural form by spending 1d4+2 actions.  
Any wounds it receives this way will always apply to the that exterior's form, though it will always draw on the hitpoints of its natural form. Anytime an attack would qualify to damage armor against the flaiskajanter, it instead cause part of its exterior to be marred in a gorssly inappropriate manner- affording something a chance to notice on a DV 14 [Prcp] check.
