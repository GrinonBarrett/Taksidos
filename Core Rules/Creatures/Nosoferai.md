#### Special Features

**Fiendish Nature**: The nosoferai's fiendish nature bestows it with a few particular features;  
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • Is not subject to bleeding.  
 • Is immune to the diseases, poisons, and venom.  
 • Gains a bonus to all saves equal to current hitpoints.  
 • Is not affected by spells which would affect the flesh.   
 • Receives wounds, but no effect from them.

**Infernal Regeneration**: At the end of any round the nosoferai receives a wound and has any hitpoints remaining, it may use its reaction to roll a d20 and compare it to its current hitpoints. If the result is lower, it recovers 2 hitpoints. It must perform a rest before doing so again.

**Celarity**: When rolling for initiative, it rolls an additional d8.

**Plague Spreader**: The nosoferai does not suffer the effects of a disease, but can immediately spread it by contact with an unarmed attack from or against it.

**Toxic Lifestyle**: Toxic attacks do not wound a nosoferai, but instead recover one of its hitpoints. A critical hit will remove spell sickness from it equal to the points of success. In place of an attack damaging the nosoferai's armor (which it doesn't typically wear and would not benefit from if it did), it recovers a level of fatigue.

**Infectious Step**: As an action, or in place of normal movement, the nosoferai may choose one of the following dice (d2, d3, d4, d6, d8, d10,or d12). It takes that many points of spell sickness, but moves an equal number of yards. *When it reappears, a noxious gas is emitted 25 yards outward which lasts for 1d6+4 rounds*. Anything in the area at the time the gas is produced and anything which starts and ends a round in it is subject to a toxic attack. Additionally, if a creature with no hitpoints started and ended its turn in the area, it is subject to a toxic attack. In place of damaging armor, this gas will daze a creature until the end of the next round. This gas cannot affect other nosoferoi in any way.

**Horrid Wave**: The nosoferai may unleash a wave of necrotic energy out semifan up to 50 yards as an action. The maximum length of this semifan is reduced by a number of yards equal to its current spell sickness. It gains spell sickness equal to half of the length in yards of the semifan produced unless it chooses to take on a level of fatigue.

**Parting Poison**: When the nosoferai is destroyed, *it inflicts up to 3 toxic attacks divided as it chooses among creatures within 25 yards*.

**Plague Birthing**: If the nosoferai spits on a corpse which has been dead no longer than a minute, that corpse will reanimate as a Plague Birthed after 1d4+1 rounds.
