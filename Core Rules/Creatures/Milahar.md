#### Special Features

**Elemental Nature**: Milahar are bodies of salt and elemntal energy. As such they;  
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom.  
 • Immune to the effects of bloodloss.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh.  

**Magic Resistance**: The Milahar gains a +2 to defense against magical attacks and a 2d8 bonus to saves against magical effects.

**Sapping Strike**: The unarmed attacks of a milahar cause dehydration. This increases its need for hydration by a number servings equal to the points of success. A creature which dies of thirst this way becomes a husk of itself. 

**Salt form**: If a serving of water makes contact with the milahar, it suffers an acid attack, but gains a +4 bonus to defense against it. If any part of it is submerged in water, it suffers an acid attack at the end of the round as part of it dissolve into the water.

#### Malaharine Salt
When the Milahar is "killed", it ceases to be animate. The salt which composes its body, which is not found naturally, remains in the shape the milahar. This salt is quite valuable for alchemists and can fetch about $290-340 per pound.
