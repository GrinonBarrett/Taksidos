**Sun Burst**: As an action, the sun bear may loose a burst of light from the brighter colored fur patch on its chest. This affects everything in a 5 yard cone ahead of the bear, in addition to anything within a yard. All affected creatures must make a [Prcp] save with a DV of 13 or be dazed and blind. At the end of each round, an affected creature may attempt the save again to end the effect, getting a +1 bonus to the save for each previously failed save. The sun bear must perform a long or full rest before using this ability again.
