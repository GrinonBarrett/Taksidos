**Magic Resistance**: When the taraskar would perform a save against a magical effect, it rolls an additional d12 and applies it as a bonus.

**Taraskine Shell**: Attacks made against this creature from behind suffer a 1d4 penalty. It gets an additional +1 against magical attacks this way.

**Immagical**: The taraskar cannot lose its last hitpoint as a result of a magical effect nor can it be instantly killed by the effect of magic or a spell. A magical weapon inflicting a wound can still inflict a wound as normal.

**Toxic Breath**: The taraskar constantly exhudes a fog of poisonous vapor. Any creature which breathes whilst within 2 yards of the taraskar must succeed a [Fort] save with a DV of 16 or lose 1 hitpoint. If it has no hitpoints, it must instead perform an incapacitation save.

**Breath Weapon**: The taraskar may exhude a concentrated blast of its toxic breath, as an action. This is a line 9 yards in length and is half a foot high and wide. Anything caught within the line suffers a Toxic attack. A creature which does not need to breathe is immune to this. It may do so once per encounter and an additional time between full rests.
Alternatively, it may cause the breath weapon to take the form of a cone. Doing so reduces the length to one third of its usual length as it sweeps its head side to side.
