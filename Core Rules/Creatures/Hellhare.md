While in its animal form, which appears like a normal hare, it has its run speed doubled and unarmed attack range is halved. While in its alternate form, which appears as a monstrous furless bipdeal abominations with the ears of the hare, it gains a +1 to defense and a +1 to its unarmed attack rolls.

**Great Leap**: Its leap distance is doubled.

**Unnatural Leap**: Once per encounter, *it may increase the distance of one of its leaps by a number of yards equal to its current hitpoints*.

**Infernal Regeneration**: At the end of any round the hellhare receives a wound and has any hitpoints remaining, it may use its reaction to roll a d20 and compare it to its current hitpoints. If the result is lower, it recovers a single hitpoint. It must perform a rest before doing so again.
