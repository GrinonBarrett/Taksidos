#### Special Features

**Show of Strength**: When the thursar would gain a bonus to their melee attack due to having a higher [Body] score, they may choose to replace their +1 bonus to the attack with a bonus equal to their [Body] bonus. If they do, their foe adds their [Body] bonus to their defense.

**Vile Smell**: Any checks made to detect a thursar by smell gains a 1d12 bonus.

**Thursaine Aura**: Any creature within 25 yards is subject to accrue a disease known as the Fetid Fever. After exposure for a number of minutes equal to 1d20 + the subjected creature's [Fort] score, it will contract the disease. A thursar is immune to this.

**Toxic Aura**: After a full minute being within 25 yards of a thursar *a creature is subject to a toxic attack at the end of each round while within 25 yards of the thursar*. This is a magical diseas effect.

**Venomous Attacks**: Anytime the thursar inflicts a critical hit with an attack roll, whether it be an unarmed attack, weapon attack, or spell- it also *inflicts a toxic attack*.

**Poison Spreader**: If the thursar is affected by a poison, venom, or disease- it *will spread it in addition to the Fetid Fever of its Thursaine Aura feature*.
