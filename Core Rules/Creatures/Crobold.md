**Nimble Flight**: While flying, the crobold adds its [Rflx] bonus to its defense against all attacks made at a range of 5 yards or greater.

Any creature which hears it must make a [Prcp] save with a DV equal to the crobold's [Inte] score + [Fort] bonus or believe the intended creature is making the intended sound. More extreme attempts, such as specific calls of exotic birds or the screech of a much different avian such as the aretheus are at the narrator’s discretion.
