**Sferakozine Nature**: The unusual nature of the sferakoz has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect eldritch creatures.  
**-** Cannot be affected by spells which would affect the flesh.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect.  
**-** Receives wounds, but not effects from them.  
**-** Does not produce warmth. 

**Odd Anatomy**: The sferakoz can move with no preference as to orientation, effectively treating itself as having no discernable top or bottom and may hover in any direct it can see. So long as it can see a threat, it is never considered to be attacked from behind or flanked. If it cannot see a threat, it is as being attacked from behind.

**Limited Senses**: The sferakoz has no sense of feeling, hearing, taste, or touch. It cannot receive stimuli from such things in any capacity as a result (including illusory effects).

**Perfect View**: The sferakoz's eye provides a full hemispherical view. The sferakoz can detect if what its seeing is magic.

**Tremendous Gaze**: As an action, the sferakoz can lock its gaze on another creature. If that creature can see the sferakoz- it must succeed an opposed [Will] check or stop whatever activity it is doing. This is treated as a brawl with the following differences;  

* They are not in physical contact. This can limit what features a foe can use while brawling.
* Only one opposed check is made at a time, it is a [Will] check.
* The opposing creature cannot Shove, Slam, or Grapple the sferkoz. The sferkoz cannot Grapple this way, but it can Shove or Slam.
* A creature does not benefit from the wrestling skill.
* As an additional option upon achieving a critical success, an opposing creature may break the gaze. This ends the pseudo brawl and prevents the sferakoz from doing so against that foe for 24 hours.

**Glow**: The sferakoz may opt to emit dim light out 3 yards as an action. It may supress this as an action.

**Prismatic Cone**: The sferakoz can produce a cone of light out 9 yards. This inflicts a radiant attack against anything caught in the area. Additionally, the brightness of the cone leaves any are of bright light in its place until the end of the round. It must rest to use this ability again.
