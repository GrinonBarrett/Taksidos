**Winged Lunge**: As an action or reaction, a skritterfalkh may push itself away from a surface or object capable of bearing its weight and perform a small burst of flight. It is treated as performing a jump, with the maximum height and distance doubled. This movement does not count against its limitation on flying in the round.

**Terrifying Leap**: Once per encounter, it may quadruple its leap distance.

**Venomous Bite**: When the skritterfalkh has successfully afflicted a creature with its venomous bite, that creature is subject to a psychic attack. For a number of minutes equal to 100 divided by the foe's [Fort] score, the venom will inflict a psychic attack at the end of each minute. Additionally, the afflicted creature is considered vulnerable to all other psychoc attacks during this time.

**Fleet Foot**: During the first round of an encounter, the skritterfalkh may use its action to perform a move.

**Swift Step**: If the skritterfalkh would gain exhaustion for sprinting because it ran, it may choose simply not to. It must complete a rest before doing so again.
