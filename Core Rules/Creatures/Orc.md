### Orcs
Horrific in appeareance, they appear as grotesque sculptures of what an animalistic humanoid might be. They are a warrior species whose entire creed was to follow the balance of the cycle of death while they struggled to survive. They have almost all been wiped out. They are notoriously the ones who wiped out nearly every elf in the western world. They themselves would suffer a similar fate later at the hands of the Crusade of the Sun. They aren't always hostile, but they can be quick to mortal resolution of a situation. They are friendlier to those that follow the deity Othmazdo, for his relationship to the cycle of life and death. They even refer to it by an archaic term, Aurkkuz, from which the name orc is derived. They despise undead. Their collective noun is a Tribe.
