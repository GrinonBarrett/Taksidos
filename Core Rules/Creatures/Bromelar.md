#### Special Features

**Plant Nature**: As a plant creature, the bromelar has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe or sleep. They must still rest.  
**-** Immunity to diseases unless they specifically affect plants.  
**-** Immunity to Bloodloss.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated except by an effect which explicitly affects plants.  

**Alacrity**: When rolling for initiative, the bromelar may use its reaction to move a number of feet equal to its result- so long as it does not exceed the appropriate mode of movement. It decides this after turn order is determined, but before actions are taken.

**Thorny**: Anytime the bromelar successfully grapples a foe, is attacked by a melee range unarmed attack, is trampled, or performs an opposed check in a brawl, it inflicts a piercing attack against that creature.

**Great Leap**: The bromelar may roll a d4, d6, or d8 as an action. It receives spell sickness equal to the result. It then ejects a number of thorns equal to the result, each inflicting a piercing attack against a different creature it can perceive within 25 yards. It can combine multiple projectiles into a single attack against a creature. If it does, it inflicts only a single attack against that creature which gains a +1 bonus for each additional projectile in the attack.

**Undo Undeath**: The bromelar gains a +2 bonus to all attacks against undead creatures. Additionally, each successful attack by the bromelar against a creature of undeath reduces its points of undeath by an aditional 1d8 points.
