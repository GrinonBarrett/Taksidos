### Stoker
A fiend which dances in the smoke of wildfires. Stokers take delight in watching the world burn. They do not usually provoke the fight, instead opting to disappear if something might distrub them, but can be heavily excited when hostilities do occur. They aren't against joing into a fight amongst other creatures if they happen upon such a sight. They more pain they feel, the more dedicated to the fight they get. They are attracted to trails of smoke. Their collective noun is a bundle.
