### Special Features

**Ephemeral Nature**: Frozen spectres do not have a phsyical form. As such they   
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.  
 • Enter an "ephemeral absence" to rest. They may choose how long to rest this way before entering the ephemeral absence.  
 • Have disadvantage on [Body] checks.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom including toxic damage.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh or physically manipulate them.  
 • Are not subject to incapacitation saves.  
 • Cannot be healed except through rest.  
 • Have advantage on saves against effects which would grapple, restrain, or make the forzen spectre prone unless it specifies that they affect ephemera.

 **Ethereal**: The manifest energy used by Frozen Spectres exists primarily in the ethereal plane, but is phased into the material plane to some extent. This makes them unaffected by physical matter and bestows a few advantages.  
    • Physical objects on the material plane are completely passable by the Frozen Spectre.  
    • The spectre is not subject to the whims of gravity and can retain its position (relatively speaking) or move in any direction, so long as it is not hindered, using its full movement speed.  
    • Non-magical forms of damage have no effect on the Frozen Spectre unless sourced from the ethereal plane.  
    • The spectre cannot be grappled, restrained, or made prone by any non-magical means from the material plane.  
    • Spectre ignores all defenses from material armor when attacking a creature and ignores a target’s cover from material objects when performing its ghastly touch. If a foe is armored, this allows it to use the lowest defense against that attack from the foe's armored value and unarmored value.  
    • Spectre can interact with the ethereal plane normally.  

**Mindless**: Frozen spectres do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing affects and fear-based effects.

**Limited Sensing**: The frozen spectre is devoid of organs to sense. It can see, hear, and feel like most humanoids on the ethereal plane and is capable of simultaneously viewing into the material plane. It has difficulties seeing in the material plane and is often drawn to brighter lights.

**Resistances**: For the purpose of determining the point of undeath lost from cold, necrotic, and psychic attacks against the frozen spectre- use the points of success and not the attack total.

**Cold Touch**: When the frozen spectre successfully hits a creature, it may use its reaction to inflict a special cold effect. Treat as a cold attack against that same creature with the following exceptions.  
* A d12 is rolled instead of a d20.  
* The spectre gains a bonus equal to its [Empy] bonus to the attack roll.

**Warded by Flame**: Fire damage dealt to the frozen spectre can cause it to fully retreat into the ethereal plane for sometime. It will retreat for a number of rounds equal to the attack roll total. A narrator may choose to ignore this for some encounters as it can lead to undesirable gameplay issues.  
It should still be noted that frozen spectres will not voluntarily cross a barrier made of flame, even one of a non-magical nature.
