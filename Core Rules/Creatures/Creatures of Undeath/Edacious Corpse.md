#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the edacious corpse has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Mindless**: Edacious corpses do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing affects and fear-based effects.

**Unnecessary Hunger**: The edacious corpse does not need to eat, but is driven to do so. If it must choose betwwen a fighting foe, a fleeing foe, or a dead creature which is nearer to it than a foe- it will go for the corpse first and remain focused on it so long as it is not distrubed. It can restore points of undeath as it eats, regaining 1 per pound of creature consumed. If it has a flashback and is undisturbed, there is a 1 in 12 chance that it may instead find an alternative food source that matches something it ate while alive.

***Creating an Edacious Corpse***: It is possible for one to use the Animate spell to create an edacious from the corpse of one who starved to death if it is cast as a 2nd tier or greater. On a critical success, the caster may modify how many rounds it will requireto animate by an amount up to the points of success. On a critical failure, the corpse is animated- but seeks the destruction of the one that created it. It instinctively knows if a creature it perceives is its creator. Once its creator is dead and it has tasted its flesh, it will cease to be animate about 2d20+30 minutes later.  
The corpse is fully animate 1d10+1d20 rounds after the spell completes.  

Occasionally, one simply occurs if one starves to death.  No magic needed.
