#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the spartai has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Mindless**: Spartoi do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing affects and fear-based effects.

**Limited Sensing**: The spartai is devoid of organs to sense, but can sense the vibrations in its bones- essentially giving it a sense of hearing and touch. It is also capable of seeing through 3 cones of effect, the eye sockets and nose hole- which each have the same effectiveness as ahuman's eyes for sight. It can also hear sound which travels through these cones.

***Creating a Spartai***: It is possible for one to use the Animate spell to create a spartai from a reletively fleshless skeleton if it is cast as a 4th tier or greater. THe remains must belong to a fallen warrior of some kind. On a critical success, the spartai will not be aggressive to its creator. It can be give an a target to pursue or a point to guard while it is forming. THe spartai will only be passive to its creator for 1d3-1 hours per point of success. On a critical failure, the spartai is animated- but seeks the destruction of the one that created it. It instinctively knows if a creature it perceives is its creator.  
The spartai is fully animate 1d6+2 rounds after the spell completes.
