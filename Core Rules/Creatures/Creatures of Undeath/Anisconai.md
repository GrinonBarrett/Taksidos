### Special Features

**Ephemeral Nature**: Anisconoi do not have a phsyical form. As such they   
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.  
 • Have disadvantage on [Body] checks.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom including toxic damage.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh or physically manipulate them.  
 • Are not subject to incapacitation saves.  
 • Cannot be healed except through rest.  
 • Have advantage on saves against effects which would grapple, restrain, or make the anisconai prone unless it specifies that they affect ephemera.

**Psychical**: Anisconai exist on the psychic plane, but can perceive into our material plane.

 **Psychical Shift**: The anisconai may use a full round to begin manifesting itself partially into the material plane. This bestows a few features:    
    • Physical objects on the material plane are completely passable by the Anisconai.  
    • The Anisconai is not subject to the whims of gravity and can retain its position (relatively speaking). 
    • Non-magical forms of damage have no effect on the Anisconai unless sourced from the paychic plane.  
    • The Anisconai cannot be grappled, restrained, or made prone by any non-magical means from the material plane.  
    • Ths Anisconai ignores all defenses from material armor when attacking a creature and ignores a target’s cover from material objects when performing its ghastly touch. If a foe is armored, this allows it to use the lowest defense against that attack from the foe's armored value and unarmored value.  
    • The Anisconai knows the location of any non-mindless creature within a number of yards equal to its [Prcp] score.

**Depress Minds**: Anytime the Anisconai rolls for initiative, each non-mindless creature which also rolls for initiative *is subject to a psychic attack. In place of inflicting a wound, it inflicts 1d4+1 points of inebriation and leaves the subject sad as long as they possess points of inebriation*.

**Sweeping Grasp**: When attacking with its ghastly touch attack, the anisconai cleave. It will do so if multiple creatures are within range for it. This is the only time it uses its reaction.
