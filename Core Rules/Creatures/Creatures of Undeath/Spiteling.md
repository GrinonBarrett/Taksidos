### Special Features

**Phantasmal Nature**: The spitelings uncommon nature as something between an ephemra and fiend bestows it with a few particular features;  
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.  
 • Are not subject to bleeding.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom including toxic damage.  
 • Are not subject to incapacitation saves.  
 • Cannot be healed by an effect.  
 • Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
 • Does not produce warmth.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect the flesh.  
 • Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. It cannot recover them in any way.

**Mindless**: Spitelings do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing affects and fear-based effects.

**Destroyed by Light**: Contact with non-magical fair or bright light will destroy a spiteling automatically.
