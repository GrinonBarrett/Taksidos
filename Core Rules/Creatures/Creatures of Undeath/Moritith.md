### Moritith
Creatures doomed to live in the shadows. Though many are hostile or malicious, occassionally one is found which seems to have moved on from such feelings and is simply looking for a way to live.

### Special Features

**Shadowy**: Moritithi are creatures of shadow and as a result possess a few traits which make them difficult to deal with;    
The moritith exists where the light does not touch, this means they may only exist in a constant state of darkness.  
 • So long as it does not end the round in it, the moritith may use its movement to cross illuminated areas.  
 • Moritithi are unaffected by darkness and can see in it as though it were fair light.  
 • If a moritith is somehow trapped in light, it treats bright light as most creatures would treat darkness. It treats fair and dim light as most creatures would treat dim light. It will also become dazed while it is trapped in the light.   
 • Non-magical forms of damage have no effect on the moritith.  
 • The moritith cannot be grappled, restrained, or made prone by any non-magical means.  
 • The moritith ignores all ethereal/material armor when attacking a creature which is in dim light or no light at all using its unarmed attack.  
 • A moritith ignores a target’s cover from objects when it strikes a foe with its unarmed attack.  
 • Moritithi make no sound when they move.  
 • Moritithi cast no shadow or reflection when observed.  
 • Moritithi do not need to eat or drink.  
 • Moritithi only gain a full or long rest's benefits if they use their Maring feature against another creature.  
 • Cannot wear armor.  
 • Immunity to damage from falling and knockback.  
 • Immunity to all poisons, venom, and diseases.  
 • Immunity to the effects of bloodloss.  
 • Immunity to effects that affect flesh.  
 • Immunity to fatigue except as a cost to use class features, actions, or magic items.  
 • Immunity to sleep.  
 • Immunity to effects which cause asphyxiation.  
 • Immunity to incapacitation.  
 • A weapon which is illuminated in some way gains advantage on attacks against it. Treat a lit torch as an illuminated club.  
 • Damage from radiant sources reduces the maximum points of undeath of a moritith rather than dealing damage. The moritith regains 1 of these per a short rest, 3 per a long rest, and all per a full rest. 
 • Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Maring**: The moritith cannot recover by resting. It must instead leech the rest of another, sleeping, creature. This requires it grapples the sleeping creature. The grapple itself does not wake the sleeping creature. If it spends at least 1 hour doing so, and that creature completes a long or full rest- it will have partialley mared its rest. The formerly sleeping creature's rest is reduced to be a lower grade (short rest if it was long, long rest if it was full) and the moritith is considered to have completed a short rest. If the moritith spends enough time to complete a long rest while grappling the sleeping creature, and the sleeping creature would complete a long or full rest, the moritith instead gains the benefit of that rest.  
Additionally, the moritith may choose to inflict a level of fatigue against the sleeping creature to recover a level of its own fatigue.  
A moritith cannot affect Elementals, Ephemera, Monsters, or Undead with this.

**Psychophysicality**: Anytime the moritith would inflict an unarmed atttack, it may instead treat it as a psychic attack.

**Dreary Breath**: As an additional option when it succeeds a critical success while brawling, it may inflict an undamaging attack against the foe. If it is successful, that creature receives a level of fatigue. A creature affected this way cannot be affected by the same moritith's Dreary Breath until that gained fatigue has been recovered.

**Phantasmal Trample**: A moritith can trample as though it were a mount, in place of brawling, if it makes contact as a result of sprinting. If it would inflict a crushing attack as a result of the trample, it may choose to treat it as a psychic attack. Additionally, if it slams a foe, it inflicts an unarmed attack against that foe- which would be treated as a psychic attack due to its Psychophysicality.

**Weak**: A moritith's weight load limits are halved.

**Metallic Vulnerability**: Every Moritith has a vulnerability to a particular metal. It cannot purposefully come in contact with that metal and will immediately know if it is the appropriate metal as soon as it can perceive it. Any attack made by an item made from the metal removes an additional points of undeath equal to one-tenth of the $ value per pound of that metal. Any contact with the chosen metal (uncluding being struck) leaves it vulnerable until at least two whole rounds have passed since it came in contact with it. Non-magical attacks from weapons of the metal can harm it.
