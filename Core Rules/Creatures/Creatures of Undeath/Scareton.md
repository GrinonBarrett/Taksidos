#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the scareton has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Frightful Gaze**: Once per encounter, _the scareton's eyeless stare can unsettle a foe within 10 yards which sees it. This requires the creature make a DV 15 [Will] save_ or be frightened of the scareton. While frightened this way, the creature must use its movement to make as much distance as it can from the skeleton.

**Spooking**: Once per encounter, as an action, the scareton will freak out- making all manner of horrific noise. Treat as an undamaging attack against a foe within 30 yards. Instead of inflicting a wound, the foe will be dazed until the end of the next round.

**Limited Senses**: The scareton is devoid of organs to sense, but can sense the vibrations in its bones- essentially giving it a sense of hearing and touch. It can see out of its eye sockets.
