### Dyllakhar
Personal messengers of Tamas. They are also known as the headless harbingers. They often appear within days before one dies, a sort of last chance to make things right before death. When their subject dies, they will come to collect. The plural would be dyllakhain.

**Creature Type**: Dyllakhain are undead.

**Size**: They stand at 6 feet. They weigh 78 pounds. They are medium creatures.

**Undeath**: A dyllakhar has 675 points of undeath.

**Run Speed**: It may run up to 5 yards per move.

**Weapon Attacks**: The dyllakhar is capable of using weapons. It even has Expertise and Warrior mastery with flails and clubs. It also has expertise with a weapon and specialization with another.

The dyllakhar will typically be armed with one of the following weapons (enchanted chain whip, enchanted handaxe, enchanted shortsword, enchanted warpick) and an enchanted club. There is an 80% chance that it will also have a Shakasawt in place of the enchanted club (or the enchanted chain whip if it would have had that).

 â€¢ Smack: The dyllakhar may use a limb or random object against a foe within 1 foot. This is a melee bare attack.

#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the Dyllakhar has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Receives wounds, but no effects from them.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Magic Resistance**: When the dyllakhar makes a save against a magical effect, it rolls a d8 and adds it to the result. Its also gets a +2 to defense against magical attacks.

**Limited Sensing**: The dyllakhar is devoid of organs to sense, but can sense the vibrations in its bones- essentially giving it a sense of hearing and touch. It also perceives everything its head perceives.

**Melded Armor**: Though it does not always appear to be armored, there is protection embedded into the dyllakhar's form. Anytime an effect would damage the dyllakhar's armor- it instead reduces its points of undeath by 1d20.

**Terrifying Presence**: When initiative is rolled, anything else rolling for initiative must succeed a [Will] save with a DV equal to the Dyllakhar's [Will] score + [Empy] bonus or be deathly afraid of it. A critical failure forces a creature to be stunned with fear for a number of phases equal to the points of failure, causing them to be dazed and vulnerable during this time. A creature which can directly percieve the Dyllakhar, has no remaining hitpoints, and a [Will] score below the Dyllakhar is incapacitated by the fear (but stable).  

**Loose Head**: The Dyllakhar's head is a seperate object, devoid of any color. It is foul and fetid smelling. It possesses the 5 basic senses and can perceive the effects of magic with them. Additionally, the head can be used as a weapon by the dyllakhar to inflict a melee biting attacks against a foe within 1 yard.  

**Repelling a Dyllakhar**: A dyllakhar cannot enter saltwater or running water.
