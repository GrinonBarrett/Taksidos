#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creatures, the corpse craver has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Rune Warded**: As part of the process of creating a corpse craver, a special rune or sigil is created that will ward the corpse craver. Furthermore, it will typically order any of its flesh renders away from where it perceives the rune/sigil. If the corpse craver perceive the rune, it is dazed. If the exposed rune is within 5 yards of the corpse craver, it is vulnerable. The corpse craver cannot come within 1 yard of the rune.

**Unnecessary Hunger**: The corpse craver does not need to eat, but is driven to do so. If it must choose betwwen a fighting foe, a fleeing foe, or a dead creature which is nearer to it than a foe- it will go for the corpse first and remain focused on it so long as it is not distrubed. It can restore points of undeath as it eats, regaining 1 per pound of creature consumed.

**Bone Cleaner**: If a corpse craver strips a humanoid (or playable species) corpse of all flesh, the skeleton will become a skeletal render within 1d4 hours).

-----

***Creating a Corpse Craver***: It is possible for one to use the Animate spell to create a corpse from the corpse of one who starved to death if it is cast as a 3rd tier or greater and the subject is properly prepared. On a critical success, the caster will know when exactly the creature is reanimated, the moment it happens. On a critical failure, the corpse is animated- but seeks the destruction of the one that created it. It instinctively knows if a creature it perceives is its creator. Once its creator is dead and it has tasted its flesh, if it was animated by a critical failure, it will cease to be animate about 2d20+30 minutes later (along with any skeletal renders under its control).  

To prepare the subject, the caster must allow them to die of starvation. Then, they must create a number of runes of an identical form. Half of the subject's brain must be removed (or alternatively the brain is placed into the stomach) and placed within a circle of equidistant runes. A fine feast must be placed for the subject. Once its brain has finished decomposing, the corpse will awaken and conusme what is left of the feast. Upon doing so, it is fully transitioned into a corpse craver.
