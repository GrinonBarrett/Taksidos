### Kzugar
They appear as a flame of vibrant color. They move like a dancing flame. Their eminence betrays perception, being an indescribeably colorless glow which flickers unlike any known flame and creeps around any corner and portal it passes. They consume no air in their stride, yet make hard the breathing of any witness. No motive can be possessed in observence of their being, no emotion, no certainty other than the way they descend upon their target. Once they occupy the space of a creature, they will not leave it be. They all serve Fzugarah. The plural is Kzugain. Their collective noun is a storm.

#### Special Features

**Ephemeral Nature**: Kzugain do not have a phsyical form. As such they   
 • Do not need to sleep or breathe.  
 • Have disadvantage on [Body] checks.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom including toxic damage.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh or physically manipulate them.  
 • Are not subject to incapacitation saves.  
 • Cannot be healed except through rest.  
 • Have advantage on saves against effects which would grapple, restrain, or make the kzugar prone unless it specifies that they affect ephemera.

**Kzugaine Phase**: The Kzugar exists in a sliver of reality between the material and psychic planes. This bestows a few features:    
 • Physical objects on the material or psychic plane are completely passable by the Kzugar if it uses its reaction in response to moving into that space.  
 • It is not subject to the whims of gravity and can retain its position (relatively speaking). It can also move in conformity to gravity.  
 • Non-magical forms of attack have disadvantage on the Kzugar.  
 • The Kzugar cannot be grappled, restrained, or made prone by any non-magical means from the material or psychic plane.  
 • The Kzugar knows the location of any non-mindless creature within a number of yards equal to its [Prcp] score, even through material obstruction.  
 • It can occupy the same space on the material or psychic plane as another creature.  
 • Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Enkefalophage**: A kzugar's hunger is not sated through typical means. It must consume brains to survive. Upon consuming the entirety of a creatures brain, it is considered to have received a number of food portions equal to its [Inte] bonus. If it consumes the brain of a sapient creature (such as a playable species), it instead is considered to have consumed food portions equal to that creature's [Inte] score. The kzugar does not need to drink. If it consumes the brain of a creature afflicted by points of inebriation, it immediately gains those points of inebriataion.

**Unusual Dietary Features**: THe Kzugar requires only half as much food as a creature of its size and is immune to inebriation other than that which it obtains through eating.

**Consuming Being**: When a movement phase ends, if the kzugar occupies the same space as another creature, it inflicts a psychic attack and fire attack against that creature. *It then also inflicts a fire attack against that creature*. A creature reduced below 0 hitpoints this way, other than a creature of undeath, is immediately consumed by the flaming being. All of its knowledge (memories, languages known, etc.) is absorbed by the Kzugar. Nothing remains of the destroyed creature.

**Globocclusion**: It can see in a complete globe around itself instead of a single direction.

**Glow**: It produces dim light out for 5 yards. This glow exists on the material plane and the psychic plane.

**Resist Mundanity**: Non-magical attacks against the kzugar cannot be critical hits.
