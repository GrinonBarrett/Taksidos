### Krizoi
Caused by the greed of the vanquished, these unusual figures resemble extremely slender skeletons with additional limbs of a simple variety. They are composed entire of gold, electrum, silver, or platinum (and very rarely some other valuable material). They pursue treasure of the same nature as themselves. The singular is krizai. Sometimes the name used to refer to such a creature can vary by material such as Zimai for silver or Skotaqai for platinum. Their collective noun is horde.

**Size**: Krizoi stand between 4 and 10 feet. They can weigh between 20 and 500 pounds. They are medium or large creatures.

#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, krizoi have a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Treasure Melding**: When the krizai gains possession of a treasure of its like material, it may begin to incorporate it into its body. It can absorb 1 pound of material per minute. The material appears to liquify and melds into the krizai's form. A magic item instead become embedded into the form, permanently entreating to the will of the krizai.

**Corpse Processing**: When the krizai kills a creature in the pursuit of treasure, it is capable of stripping its body in an attempt to rearrange the components it receives on a molecular level to produce the desired element. For 100 pounds of material it processes this way, it gains an ounce of material. The processed corpse is no longer recognizable. It can , and will only attempt to, process one of its own victims this way.

**Mindlessly Greedy**: Animate skeletons do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing affects and fear-based effects. If an object of the same material as their composition is presented, their focus will shift to it.

**Limited Senses**: The krizai is devoid of organs to sense, but can sense the vibrations in its frame- essentially giving it a sense of hearing and touch. It is also capable of seeing through 3 cones of effect, the eye sockets and nose hole- which each have the same effectiveness as a human's eyes for sight. This sight can only see reflective surfaces, but may do so in dim or bright light as though it were fair light.

**Reviving a Krizai**: If even $1 of like material comes in contact with a krizai, it is restored to a single point of undeath. This can include part of the krizai's form being completely removed and reincorporated into the krizai.

-----

***Creating Krizoi***: Adventurers, nobles, and others afflicted by greed can become a krizai. If the slain materialist is buried with their treasure and a 3rd tier or greater Animate is cast upon the corpse, the treasure will begin to meld with the corpse (as though by the Treasure Melding feature), this will include treasure buried with it even if it was not the slain's or the proper material. Once the melding completes, the krizai is animated. On a critical success, the creator may choose what material the krizai will favor from among the treasures buried with them so long as. On a critical failure, the krizai is animated, but seeks to destroy its creator and process their corpse. It instinctively knows if a creature it perceives is its creator. If it successfully processes the corpse of its creator when made in this fashion, it ceases to be animat and simply a from of its material composition.
