### Special Features

**Ephemeral Nature**: Anisconoi do not have a phsyical form. As such they   
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.  
 • Have disadvantage on [Body] checks.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom including toxic damage.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh or physically manipulate them.  
 • Are not subject to incapacitation saves.  
 • Cannot be healed except through rest.  
 • Have advantage on saves against effects which would grapple, restrain, or make the anisconai prone unless it specifies that they affect ephemera.
 • Physical objects are completely passable by the ???, but consume three times as much movement.  
 • The Anisconai is not subject to the whims of gravity and can retain its position (relatively speaking).   
 • Non-magical forms of damage have no effect on the ???.  
 • The Anisconai cannot be grappled, restrained, or made prone by any non-magical means.  

**Depress Minds**: Anytime the Anisconai rolls for initiative, each non-mindless creature which also rolls for initiative *is subject to a psychic attack. In place of inflicting a wound, it inflicts 1d4+1 points of inebriation and leaves the subject sad as long as they possess points of inebriation*.

**Sweeping Grasp**: When attacking with its ghastly touch attack, the anisconai cleave. It will do so if multiple creatures are within range for it. This is the only time it uses its reaction.
