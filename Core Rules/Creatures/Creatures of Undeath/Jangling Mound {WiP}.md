#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, jangling mounds have a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Unwounding**: A jangling mound never receives wounds, it only loses points of undeath.

**Treasure Reclamation**: When the jangling mound gains possession of a treasure which was taken from its loot, it gains it value. The jangling mound can make use of any weapon, shield, or magic item it has reclaimed this way.

**Unnatural Scoring**: When the jangling mound influcts a critical hit with its unarmed attack, *it may treat it as any attack type*.

**Mindlessly Greedy**: Animate skeletons do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing affects and fear-based effects. If an object of the same material as their composition is presented, their focus will shift to it.

**Limited Senses**: The krizai is devoid of organs to sense, but can sense the vibrations in its frame- essentially giving it a sense of hearing and touch. It is also capable of seeing through 3 cones of effect, the eye sockets and nose hole- which each have the same effectiveness as a human's eyes for sight. This sight can only see reflective surfaces, but may do so in dim or bright light as though it were fair light.

**Reviving a Krizai**: If even $1 of like material comes in contact with a krizai, it is restored to a single point of undeath. This can include part of the krizai's form being completely removed and reincorporated into the krizai.

-----

***Creating Krizoi***: Adventurers, nobles, and others afflicted by greed can become a krizai. If the slain materialist is buried with their treasure and a 3rd tier or greater Animate is cast upon the corpse, the treasure will begin to meld with the corpse (as though by the Treasure Melding feature), this will include treasure buried with it even if it was not the slain's or the proper material. Once the melding completes, the krizai is animated. On a critical success, the creator may choose what material the krizai will favor from among the treasures buried with them so long as. On a critical failure, the krizai is animated, but seeks to destroy its creator and process their corpse. It instinctively knows if a creature it perceives is its creator. If it successfully processes the corpse of its creator when made in this fashion, it ceases to be animat and simply a from of its material composition.
