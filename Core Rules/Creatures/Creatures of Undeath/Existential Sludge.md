#### Special Features 

**Falxemic Nature**: As a creature of such unique origin, it has a few features:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to all poisons and diseases, including toxic damage, except those that specifically affect infigura and undead.  
**-** Immunity to the effects of bloodloss.  
**-** Immunity to fatigue from outside sources.  
**-** Immunity to effects which cause asphyxiation.  
**-** Immunity to effects which would inflict the prone condition, unless it specifically targets infigura.  
**-** Immunity to incapacitation.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Amorphous**: Existential sludges don’t retain a single cohesive shape but are instead in the form of a glob of gooey material. This confers some strange properties to it.  
 • Immunity to falling and knockback damage.  
 • Obstacles that would reduce the speed of it have only half of their normal effect unless they specifically affect amorphous creatures as well.  
 • All forms of non-magical attack against it have disadvantage.  
 • Anytime a spell would be cast against it that would affect its form, shape, composition, or mental state- it gains a 2d10 bonus to its saves against that effect.  
 • It cannot be grappled.  
 • While it has a creature grappled, it can treat that creature as being unarmored for the purpose of attacking it.  
 • It is capable of traveling through any opening small enough to stick one’s finger.  
 • Cannot use armor, shields, or any item.  

**Minimal Sensing**: It is, in the most technical sense, blind. It is also devoid of the senses of smell and hearing. Instead it relies on sensing vibrations and its ability to taste everything it comes in contact with. Anytime it would attempt a check or save based on perceiving something, it has disadvantage (likewise, it should get advantage against illusions based on such stimuli). If it would rely on multiple missing senses, it suffers an additional -2 penalty for each total sense. If it is touching or tasting something, it does not have any issues identifying it.

**Mindless**: It does not have capacity for independent thought. As such, it cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. It is also unaffected by mind-influencing effects and fear-based effects.

**Deconstructive Form**: At the end of every round the existential sludge grapples a creature, it inflicts an attack against it. If the attack roll is odd, it is acid. If even, it is a biting attack. Alternatively it can consume an ounce of material in this time.

**Drowning an Existential Sludge**: If an existential sludge ever would consume and/or be surrounded by a total amount of ounces of alkohest equal to its weight in stones- the sludge ceases to be and the resulting substance is rendered inert.
