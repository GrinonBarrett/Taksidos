#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the hungering dry has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Thirst and Hunger**: The hungering dry must feed to continue to exist. They need only half as much food as a manfolk would need. It cannot die from starving, but can become petrified. It can eat a pound of salt to serve as a single serving of food. This increases its thirst 1d4+1 servings. It will die of thirst. A hungering dry petrified this way can be restored by 2 servings of water.

**Weaknesses**: The hungering dry cannot willingly touch non-sapiant plant life. If it is forced to make contact, it is vulnerable for the entire time. The unarmed attacks of plant creatures gain advantage against the hungering dry. Despite their thirst, they will not willingly cross running water and are vulnerable while submerged in any liquid.

**Unnatural Creeping**: When it is prone, it does not suffer the usual penalty to movement.

**Dry Bite**: A creature afflicted by the bite of a hungering dry must succeed a [Fort] save with a DV of 17 or receive a level of fatigue. Additionally, even if it does succeed, if it is not a critical success, their thirst is increased to need 1d4+1 additional servings of water. If a creature would die of thirst as a result, it is instead petrified. 2 servings of water can restore it from this condition, but it will become a hungering dry if it 

**Ghoulish Grasp**: Its unarmed attacks gain a 1d4 bonus and can be treated as magical. It also gains a 1d4 bonus to checks related to maintaing your grapple against a foe.

***Creating a Hungering Dry***: It is possible for one to use the Animate spell to create a hungering dry from a corpse, regardless of its condition, if it is cast as a 2nd tier or greater so long as it is in contact with an amount of salt equal to at least one-tenth of its body weight. On a critical success, the hungering dry will not be aggressive to its creator and can even be dissuaded from attacking something by its creator or given a direction to move in, but this only lasts for either 1d4-1 hours per point of success. On a critical failure, the corpse is animated- but seeks the destruction of the one that created it. It instinctively knows if a creature it perceives is its creator.  
It is fully animate 1d8+2 rounds after the spell completes.
