### Special Features

**Ephemeral Nature**: Sprixes do not have a phsyical form. As such they   
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.  
 • Enter an "ephemeral absence" to rest. They may choose how long to rest this way before entering the ephemeral absence.  
 • Have disadvantage on [Body] checks.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom including toxic damage.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh or physically manipulate them.  
 • Are not subject to incapacitation saves.  
 • Cannot be healed except through rest.  
 • Have advantage on saves against effects which would grapple, restrain, or make the forzen spectre prone unless it specifies that they affect ephemera.

**Ethereal**: Sprixes exist on the ethereal plane, but can perceive into our material plane.

 **Demiethereal Shift**: The sprix may use a full round to begin manifesting itself partially into the material plane. This bestows a few features:    
    • Physical objects on the material plane are completely passable by the Sprix.  
    • The Sprix is not subject to the whims of gravity and can retain its position (relatively speaking). 
    • Non-magical forms of damage have no effect on the Sprix unless sourced from the ethereal plane.  
    • The Sprix cannot be grappled, restrained, or made prone by any non-magical means from the material plane.  
    • Ths Sprix ignores all defenses from material armor when attacking a creature and ignores a target’s cover from material objects when performing its ghastly touch. If a foe is armored, this allows it to use the lowest defense against that attack from the foe's armored value and unarmored value.  
    • The Sprix can interact with the ethereal plane normally.  

**Withiering Form**: Anytime the Sprix accruess spell sickness, it loses an equal number of points of undeath.

**Startle Minds**: Anytime the Sprix rolls for initiative, each non-mindless creature which also rolls for initiative *is subject to a psychic attack*.

**Slow Madness**: Anytime an attack by the Sprix, its spells, or its abilities is a critical hit- it inflicts 1d2 points of inebriation against that foe.

**Spiteful Magics**: Anytime the sprix inflicts an attack as a result of a spell, it may alter it to be a toxic attack. If it was already a toxic or necrotic attack, it may alter it to be one of the following attcks instead (Dagger, Biting, Cold, Fire, Necrotic, Psychic, Toxic). It accrues a point of spell sickness as a result.

**Dark Shield**: Anytime the Sprix is attacked, it may use its reaction to take on 1d4 points of spell sickness. If it does, it gains a bonus to defense against that attack equal to the result and loses an equal number of points of undeath.

**Grave Magic**: The Sprix is capable of casting magic using the very power of undeath that animates it. It functions like wyrding with the following exceptions: 
* It rolls a d12 and adds its [Inte] bonus, [WIll] bonus, and [Empy] bonus to its roll to determine the check result.
* On a success, it loses points of undeath equal to the spell's tier instead of gaining spell sickness.
* On a failue, it loses points of sucess equal to the points of failure or spell's tier (whichevever is higher).
* On a critical failure, it loses points of undeath equal to the points of failure multiplied by the tier of the spell.
* When completing the spell, it may roll any number of d6s. It loses points of undeath equal to the result, but gains a +1 bonus to its check for die rolled this way.  

**Magical Knowledge**: A Sprix knows 3 spells, in addition to the following spells (Absend, Behest, Expulsion Sphere, Grasp, Havory, Portalence, Rotword).

**Ending a Sprix**: For all of their horror, there are many ways to put one to rest, in addition to reducing its points of undeath to 0.  
* If the amount of spell sickness it has is equal to its remaining points of undeath, it is destroyed.
* If it critically fails a counterspell and is afflicted by a ki, necrotic, or radiant attack in the same round.
* If the source of its spite and hatred has been resolved, with proof presented to it while in its demiethereal form, it will peacefully disintigrate.
