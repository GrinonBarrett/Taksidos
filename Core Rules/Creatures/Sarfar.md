### Sarfar
Large serpentine creatures. They have a head akin to an alligator. Just behind the rear of the head is a set of muscular pectoral fins. They are competent swimmers that can be surprisingly stealthy in the water. They like to travel in deep rivers and take pry from the riverside by opportunity. They seldom go on land, but will do so for hibernation when food is scare or for spawning. If they cannot swallow prey whole, they usually do not attack.

**Lengthy Breath**: It can hold its breath 10 times as long as normal.

**Built for Speed**: When sprinting, its swim speed is multiplied by the number of sprints it has performed since the start of the previous round.

**Swallow Whole**: If it successfully bites a creature of at least two size categories smaller, it may swallow it whole as an action. A creature may be able to cut its way out or succeed an opposed [Rflx] check with disadvantage using their Wrestling skill to escape.

**Strangling Crush**: As an additional option when it has a critical success while brawling, if it is grappling a foe, it can squeeze the foe to inflict a crushing attack. This gains a +1 bonus to the attack for each size cetgory below the sarfar of the creature. If the crushed creature has equal or greater [Body] score, it is only a bonus for the purpose of inflicting a crtitcal hit. This ignores the penalty for the attack while brawling. Additionally, it may simply inflict such an attack as an action if it has a creature grappled.

**Wiry**: It may use its reaction to perform a movement if it did not do so during a previous round and is not grappled or immobilized.
