**Alacrity**: When rolling for initiative, the qyizikhor may use its reaction to move a number of feet equal to its result- so long as it does not exceed the appropriate mode of movement. It decides this after turn order is determined, but before actions are taken.

**Mighty Slam**: When the qyizikhor successfully strikes a foe with its slam attack, it may use its reaction to force that creature to succeed an opposed [Body] check. If the check is a tie or success in any degree, the qyizikhor knocks the foe prone and knocks them back a number of feet equal to the points of success mulitplied by the qyizikhor's weight in stones divided by the foe's weight in stones. If the qyizikhor had a critical success, the foe is also vulnerable while they are prone.

**Glowing Eye Shine**: The qyizikhor treats dim light as fair light.

**Vile Smell**: Any checks made to detect a qyizikhor by smell gains a 2d8 bonus.
