**Lunar Sleep Cycle**: The trikhappernar does not need to breathe, drink, eat. It does still sleep, which it does for the entirety of the full moon and new moon. So long as it sleeps during these phases, it does not grow fatigued by not sleeping between these intervals.

**Eye Stalk**: The trikhappernar can rotate its vision. This occurs when rotations would during the round. The trikhappernar can rotate their vision during the same or different phases that they rotate their body. Their eye stalk may only rotate up to 45 degrees left or right. It cannot move it more than 90 degrees to the left or right.
It is able to see creatures with spell sicknes, even in total darkness so long as it is not hidden behind cover, out to a number of yards equal to that creature's spell sickness.

**Limited Senses**: The trikhappenar has no sense of smell or taste. It cannot receive stimuli from scents or tastes in any capacity as a result (including illusory effects).

**Funnel Ear**: The trikhappenar has a large funnel shaped organ which it uses to pick up sounds. It also can emit a variety of sounds from this organ. It may direct this organ in any direction so long as it is not prone. It gains a 1d6 bonus to all [Prcp] saves and checks involving sound coming from the direction the funnel is facing. The trikhappernar can rotate it during the same or different phases that they rotate their body. Their funnel may only rotate up to 45 degrees in a direction at a time.

**Directed Screech**: As an action, it sends a range of harmful frequencies out of its funnel. This produces a 10 yard cone which inflicts a sonic attack against anything caught within it. If the attack would qualify to damage armor, the foe is dazed until the end of the next round. It cannot do so again during the same or consecutive rounds.

**Scrambled Wave**: As an action, it produces a variety of frequencies which are harmful to the function of many processes. Any creature within 25 yards which can hear it is subject to a sonic attack. It must rest before doing so again.

**Three Hands**: The creature has three hands, a primary hand and two off hands. For each hand it has beyond the first remaining, its movement speeds are increased by .5 yard each.

**Weak**: The trikhappernar's weight load limits are halved.
