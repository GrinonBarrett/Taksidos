## SPECIAL ACTIONS
The following special abilities may be used by any combatant unless otherwise noted. Some may be used as action, some as reactions, and some as either.

#### About Face
Action  
You rotate up to 180 degrees. If an attack against you was successful, you may about face as a reaction.

#### Aim  
Action  
You choose a creature (or object) within range. If your next attack before the end of the next round is made against it, you gain advantage on that attack. You may also modify the wound result by 1. If you already had advantage on the attack, you may modify the wound result by 3 instead.

#### Attack
Action  
You perform an attack with an equipped weapon you are capable of attacking with or perfom an unarmed attack.

#### Attack of Opportunity
Reaction  
When a combatant enters or exits the range of your melee weapon (or unarmed attack), you may make a melee attack against them as appropriate.

#### Beat
Action or Reaction  
You force an armed opponent within your weapon's range to make an opposed [Rflx] check. Either participant gets disadvantage on their check if they are within half of their weapon's range. Each level of training a participant has with their weapon grants a +1 bonus to their result.  
A failure imposes disadvantage on the next attack, beat, or parry the failing particpant makes this round with the weapon. A critical failure disarms the failing participant.

#### Block
Reaction  
If you have a shield, may use it to impose a penalty to a single attack made aganist you or someone within range of your unarmed attack. This is determined per the shield. If you do, and the attack result is the exact amount or 1 point less than what is required to hit you, your shield is damaged (and not your armor) as a result.

#### Brace
Action  
You choose a reaction. During the next round, you may perform that reaction once without counting against your reaction for the round. If you brace again before that round, you instead change what reaction you brace for.

#### Cleave
Reaction  
Used in response to your own melee weapon attack. You cleave with your attack, causing an attack against each creature in a 180 degree arc in front of you extending out to the maximum range of the weapon beginning with the leftmost or rightmost foe first and proceeding onward. Each such attack is made with a -1 penalty and any attack within half of the weapon's range is made with disadvantage.  
If an attack is parried, a critical failure, your weapon is successfully beat, or you are successfully struck by an attack which was a response to this cleaving attack- the cleave ends and you are vulnerable until the end of the next round. You cannot perform a follow up attack to an attack this way.

#### Counter Attack
Reaction  
If a creature attempted an attack against you and it was a critical failure, you peform a melee or thrown attack against them if they are within.

#### Counterspell
Reaction  
You attempt to counter a spell which specifially targets you or which is being cast by a creature within a number of yards equal to your [Prcp] score.

#### Dive for Cover
Reaction  
In response to potentially being affected by an effect which would affect an area, a character may dive for cover by immediately moving to a position which is within a jump's distance. If they do, they replace any defense/save result with their [Rflx] score if it is higher. They are prone and vulnerable until the end of the next round regardless of which result is used. This cannot be done if already prone. If already vulnerable when doing so, they have a -4 penalty to the [Rflx] score result.

#### Dodge
Reaction  
When you are targeted for an attack you are aware of, before the attack is rolled, you may add your [Rflx] bonus to your defense. Doing this while prone will leave you vulnerable until you are no longer prone.

#### Feint
Reaction  
An altering of the angle of your attack to allow you to change its course easily. In response to your own melee attack roll, regardless of the result, you may treat it as a critical failure for the purposes of other creatures' reactions. If a creature takes a reaction in response to the attack, you may perform a melee attack against that reacting creature with advantage if it is in range. Any reaction it takes still occurs if valid.  
If no creature performed a reaction in response to it, or you simply don't want to perform the attack against that reacting foe, you attack is resolved as it would normally (using the actuual result).  
If the original target reacted, you may choose instead to gain advantage on the original attack against that foe.

#### Follow-Up
Reaction  
If you successfully attack a creature or beat their weapon, you may perform an additional melee attack against them with disadvantage. If the attack was one-handed, the attack must be made with a different hand/weapon. A two-handed attack can be repeated this way. You cannot follow up an attack if you attacked with multiple weapons simultaneously.

#### Parry
Reaction  
When you are targeted for a melee attack, or a creature within melee range is targeted for a melee attack, you may perform a [Rflx] or [Body] check against the attack. If successful, you managed to foil the attack. A critical success will leave the foe vulnerable until the end of the round. A failure in any degree results in the attack's target being struck regardless. A critical failure results in your being vulnerable until the end of the round. The DV is the opponent's attack roll total (including modifiers).  

#### Pocket
Action  
Take something within reach of your hand (or appropriate limb) and place it in a pocket or other easily accessed pouch.

#### Press Attack
Reaction  
Declared when you make an unarmed or weapon attack, you gain advantage on the attack. You also become vulnerable until the end of the round.

#### Push
Reaction  
When you attack a creature with a melee attack, you may use your reaction after rolling to attempt to knock a foe back. If your attack roll plus your [Body] bonus is higher than the foe's [Body] score, you may push them a number of feet equal to the difference, up to your [Body] score. If the attack was a critical failure, you do not push the foe.

#### Recoil
Reaction  
Use in response to receiving a wound, when the wound is determined. You may adjust the result by 1. This is resolved after an attacker's modifiers, but cannot affect an "Attacker's Choice" result.

#### Reflexive Casting
Reaction  
If the remaining casting time of your spell is only 1 action, you may complete the spell. This induces a point of spell-sickness. You will also be vulnerable until the end of the next round.

#### Side-Step
Action or Reaction  
You may move up to 1 yard using one of your modes of movement, so long as you can move up to that distance using it. This can be in any direction traversable by that mode of movement.

#### Sprint
Action  
You perform a move. You cannot do this while prone. If you already sprinted during this round or the previous round, you must take on a level of exhaustion.

#### Stand to a Charge
Reaction  
This is treated as an attack of opportunity which is made in response to a foe's movement which would cause contact. The attack is made with advantage. You then suffer disadvantage on your opposed check in the ensuing brawl, or the opposed [Rflx] check if a trample.

#### Tag
Action or Reaction  
Once per round, a character may use their action or reaction to tag with another creature they can perceive within 3 yards. The tagging creatures swap initiative chits. The current turn's creature still continues their turn as normal, with the new order taking effect during the next round. The other creature must approve of the swap for it to occur.
