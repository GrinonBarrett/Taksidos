#### Facings
Each creature has four facings, Forward, Left, Rear, and Right. The forward facing is the 90 degree area the figure is facing, whereas the rear is the opposite 90 degree facing. Between the Forward and Rear facings are the left and right facings in their respective places. If a combatant is ever attacked on its left or right facing, it is being flanked. When being attacked from the rear, the combatant is “flat-footed”. A combatant moving in any direction other than straight ahead has its movement halved.

#### Performing movement
When a combatant is to move, follow these steps:

 **•** Rotation, The combatant performs any rotation desired, up to 90 degrees.
 
 **•** Move, The combatant may move up to their appropriate movement (run or sprint) in a straight line.

##### Multiple forms of movement
Unless otherwise noted, a combatant may perform different modes of movement during a round, so long as the following conditions are satisfied:  
    1 Only one mode is used on a given move.  
    2 The unit has more than one mode of movement available.

##### Jumping
A character may jump up to half of their run speed. Alternatively, they may jump up to half of their climb speed in an appropriate situation. When swimming, aquatic creatures may jump, when they surface, up to half of their swim speed. A sprinting creature’s jump is increased by half.

##### Turn Order Chits
All combatants take turns performing their action for the phase per their turn order chit. I.e, the combatant with the first chit goes first, second chit follows them, a third chit follows them, etc.
Once each combatant has their chit, they cannot be swapped except by the effect of rare abilities or the tagging action.
If a combatant summons a creature, that creature can take its turn after the summoner, but before the next combatant with a chit.
