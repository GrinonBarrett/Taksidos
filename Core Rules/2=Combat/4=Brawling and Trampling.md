#### BRAWLING

A brawl occurs when two hostile combatants come in physical contact with each other. To determine the effects of a brawl, the attacker and defender make an opposed check*. This check benefits from both [Body] bonus and  [Rflx] bonus. Anything which would affect a [Body] or [Rflx] check can affect such a check. A success will force the opponent to forfeit their turn during the next action phase. Success with both will also force the opponent to forfeit their turn during the following action phase, presuming they are still brawling. A critical success will allow that participant to choose between the following options: Grapple, Shove, or Slam.  
A unit involved in a brawl cannot sprint and has all forms of movement reduced by half.

*A character proficient in Wrestling adds their proficiency die to their checks.

##### CONTINUING A BRAWL
So long as both combatants are still in physical contact at the end of the movement phase, they are still brawling and must perform another opposed check.

##### Grappling
A grappled creature is restrained. Anytime it would move or perform an action that requires physical motion (such as an attack or piloting a ship), it may attempt to break free of the grapple. A failure results in no effect. A success results in the creature breaking free but being unable to accomplish the action. A critical success breaks the grapple and allows the action to be undertaken. A critical failure results in the grappled creature suffering a -4 penalty to any future attempts to break free until the end of the same phase on the next round.
A grapple check is an opposed [Body] check. If the grappled creature has a higher [Rflx] than the grappling creature, it may use its [Rflx] in place of its [Body].

##### Shove
When a combatant is shoved, they are knocked back a number of feet. To determine the number of feet it is knocked back;  
Total together the shoving creature’s [Body] and the shoving creature’s weight in stones.
Divide this by half of the shoved creature’s weight in stones + its [Body].

##### Slam
A slam is a means of knocking a foe off balance. An opposed [Body] check occurs, with the slamming creature adding their weight in stones as a bonus. The defending creature adds half of their weight in stones to their check. If the slamming creature is successful, the opponent is knocked prone. If the slamming creature has a critical failure, the defending creature may choose to disengage the brawl.

#### TRAMPLING
Trampling occurs when a creature moves to engage a significantly smaller foe and is done in place of a brawl. To determine the effects of trampling, the attacker and defender make an opposed [Rflx] check (called "evading the charge") or an opposed [Body] check (called "holding your ground"), defender’s choice. If the trampling unit succeeds, the defender is knocked prone and a crushing attack is inflicted by the trampling mount.
If the defender has a critical success while holding their ground, they stop the mount and may choose to use their reaction to knock them prone.
If the defender has a critical success while evading the charge, they may use their reaction to perform a melee attack against the trampler or its rider (if it has one).
