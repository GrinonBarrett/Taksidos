### Wounds
Most creatures and playable species' have a wound chart. Anytime the character/creature receives a wound, a d20 is rolled and compared to its wound chart. If the result is of a wound that character/creature already has, a new wound is determined.


If a creature has no more wounds available, it is still considered to accrue a wound. It must perform an additional incapacitation save as the effect of this wound.

### Critical Hits

When a critical hit occurs against a creature, it inflicts an additional effect depending on the type of attack.

**Table**: *Critical hit by Attack Type*
| Attack Type            | Effect |
|------------------------|--------|
|                        |        |
| Bare Attack            | Struck creature loses a hitpoint if it has any remaining. |
|                        |           |
| Weapon Attack          | Struck creature is dealt extreme trauma. Inflict a hemorrhage against the foe. If it cannot be affected by one, instead inflict a biased wound against it. |
|                        |           |
| Acid                   | Acid begins to eat away at the creature. At the end of this round and the next, the acid causes an additional acid attack roll against the struck creature (with none of the usual combat modifiers) to possibly inflict another wound. When it performs the attack at the end of the next round, it gets advantage if it inflicted a wound at the end of the current round. If the struck creature is armored, it may expend its reaction and an action to remove compromised pieces of armor to prevent further attacks from the acid (so this can leave them in a compromised position). Multiple instances of acid critical hits are cumulative. |
| Cold                   | Struck creature must succeed a [Fort] save or be treated as prone for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. Movement is halved until the end of the next round. |
| Crushing               | Struck foe must succeed a [Body] save or suffer an additional wound and skip its turn during the next movement phase. |
| Cutting                | Inflict a biased wound against the creature. If it has none remaining, inflict a hemorrhage against it. |
| Electrical             | Creature must succeed a [Rflx] save or receive an additional wound and have its armor damaged. |
| Fire                   | The struck foe is lit ablaze. At the end of each round, the fire causes an additional fire attack roll against the struck creature (with none of the usual combat modifiers) to possibly inflict another wound at the end of each movement phase. A struck creature may expend its reaction and an action to pat out or smother the flames by rolling (uses reaction and movement). Multiple instances of fire critical hits are not cumulative. |
| Force                  | Creature must succeed a [Body] save or be knocked prone and be knocked back a number feet equal to the points of failure. |
| Ki                     | Struck foe loses a hitpoint if they have any remaining, otherwise it is vulnerable until the next time it is wounded before the end of the next round. |
| Necrotic               | Creature loses the use of one of its limbs or appendages (randomly decided). This is treated as an additional wound. This wound lasts until healed. If caused by a magical means, a magical means is required to heal it. If no such limb is available, inflict an additional wound instead. |
| Piercing               | Inflict a hemorrhage against the foe. If it cannot be affected by one, instead inflict a non-biased wound against it. |
| Psychic                | Struck foe receives a point of Spell-Sickness. Additionally, it must succeed a [Will] or [Inte] save (their choice) or be dazed for a number of rounds equal to the points of failue. |
| Radiant                | Creature is dazed until the end of the next round. Creature must succeed a [Rflx] or [Prcp] save or have disadvantage on all [Prcp] checks and saves for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. |
| Sonic                  | Struck creature must succeed a [Fort], [Will] or [Prcp] save (their choice) or become incapacitated (but stable). |
| Toxic                  | The creature has acquired a sickness which causes a -1 to all saves and disadvantage on [Fort] checks. Until this sickness is cured or the creature completes a long or full rest, anytime the creature reveives a wound it must make a [Fort] save or be treated as having an additional wound. This faux wound is actually a posion or disease and is cured as such.|
|                        |           |

A save brought about by a critical hit has a DV equal to the attack total.
