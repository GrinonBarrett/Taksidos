### UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND DEATH

A character may receive as many wounds as appropriate to their class and level. This total is referred to as hitpoints (or HP). Once they receive a wound while this pool is depleted, they must make a [Fort] or [Will] save with a DV of 10 + the number of wounds or immediately become incapacitated. If they succeed, they are still stable- but suffer a level of fatigue. A failure results in passing out (incapacitated). A critical success allows you to soldier on with no effect. A critical failure kills you.  
A creature may also have hitpoints.

This is ***the incapacitation save***.

If a combatant is incapacitated and an aggressor has no obstacles, they can simply kill their foe as an action if they have some means of inflicting damage other than an unarmed attack.

If a creature ever has 10 wounds more than its maximum hitpoints, it dies. This is referred to as massive damage.

If a creature with a Wound Table has no options remaining on the table, and receives a wound, it must perform an incapacitation save as a result of the "wound" it receives.

Anytime a creature with no remaining hitpoints is incapacitated, it takes on a level of fatigue. A creature with points of undeath is not affected by this.
