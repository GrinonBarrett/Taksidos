### UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND DEATH

A character may receive as many wounds as appropriate to their class and level. This total is referred to as hitpoints (or HP). Once they receive a wound while this pool is depleted, they must make a [Fort] or [Will] save with a DV of 10 + the number of total received wounds or immediately become incapacitated. If they succeed, they are still stable- but suffer a level of fatigue. A failure results in passing out (incapacitated). A critical success allows you to soldier on with no effect. A critical failure kills you.  
A creature may also have hitpoints.

This is **the incapacitation save**.

### A character's heroism is not applied to incapacitation saves.

If a combatant is incapacitated and an aggressor has no obstacles, they can simply kill their foe as an action if they have some means of inflicting damage other than a bare attack.

If a creature ever has 10 wounds more than its maximum hitpoints, it dies. This is referred to as massive damage.

If a creature with a Wound Table has no options remaining on the table, and receives a wound, it must perform an incapacitation save as a result of the "wound" it receives.

Anytime a creature with no remaining hitpoints is incapacitated, it takes on a level of fatigue. A creature with points of undeath is not affected by this. 

***Community Spotlight Note***
###### To help give some context for this, there is no "points of damage" in this system. Either an attack is successful enough to harm (and thus wound) or it is not. Because the DV (difficulty) value of the save is based on the total wounds accrued, a characterr with 3 maximum hitpoints taking a fourth wound must make their save at the same difficulty as a character with 1 maximum hitpoint. This allows player characters to have an idea of how many hits they can safely take in combat, and choose how much risk they want to take on in longer engagements. In the end though, death is always a possibility regardless of character level.

###### Characters can accrue hitpoints as they grow, but this is very limited. Most begining characters getting only 1 or 2 and the high end is between 4-6 depending on the build.
