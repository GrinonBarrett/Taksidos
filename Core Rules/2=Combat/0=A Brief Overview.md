### ROUND OVERVIEW

The combat begins with the Initial Step. Each round of combat is made up of the following 4 phases: Primary Movement phase, Primary Action phase, Secondary Movement phase, and Secondary Action phase.

###### *A note about non-combat encounters*: Sometimes, individuals may not be fighting per se, but are still engaged in a tense or improtant interaction. In which case, it can be ran like a combat even if there are no real “combatants”. This allows for an orderly way to direct dialogue betweens groups of individuals and ensures that if hostilities do arise- the groundwork for the encounter is already set.

#### Initial Step

At the beginning of each combat, each combatant rolls a d20 and adds it to their [Prcp] score. The combatant with the highest initiative, followed by each other combatant in descending order of initiative, chooses a turn order chit and gives it to a combatant (themselves or someone else). Each round then commences with the following steps in order.

 **Primary Movement phase**: A single mode of movement is performed. No combatant is forced to move.

 **Primary Action phase**: During this phase, each combatant may choose to use one of their various abilities or perform an attack. They may only perform one action phase.

 **Secondary Movement phase**: A single mode of movement is performed. No combatant is forced to move.

 **Secondary Action phase**: During this phase, each combatant may choose to use one of their various abilities or perform an attack. They may only perform one action phase.

 ###### For a little extra spice, a narrator may have each particpant roll for initiative during each round or when the total particpants changes.
