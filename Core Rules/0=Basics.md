 #### DICE LEVELS
Dice can be “upgraded” or “downgraded” due to various in game effects. Beginning from the lowest die and improving from there, below are all levels of dice.

**d2** (can be represented with a coin flip), **d3**,  **d4**, **d6**, **d8**, **d10**, **d12**.

#### ATTRIBUTES
**Body**  represents your physical strength and is referred to as [Body].  
**Fortitude**  represents your general health and resilience to disease and other foreign agents to the physical self. It is referred to as [Fort].  
**Reflex**  represents a character's ability to react and is referred to as [Rflx].  
**Will**  represents the strength of one's determination. It is referred to as [Will].  
**Intelligence**  represents the character’s raw eidetic ability and is referred to as [Inte].  
**Perception**  represents a character’s ability to perceive and distinguish between various stimuli. It is referred to as [Prcp].  
**Empathy**  represents the character’s ability to form emotional connections with others and is referred to as [Empy].

Unless noted otherwise, an attribute score cannot exceed 18 without the aid of magic.  
Magic can increase a character's ability score by an amount up to their level.

##### Attribute Bonus
An attribute bonus is a smaller number based on an attribute which is used to reflect the influence of the character's attrbute in situations where the full score would be too much mathematically. A creature's attribute bonus is +1 for every 3 points of attribute score.

#### CHECKS AND SAVES
A check is performed by the player’s character in an attempt to do something by the result of a skill challenge using one of their attributes. A save is performed by the character in an attempt to prevent something from happening (usually something that would happen to them).
In both cases, 3d6 is rolled and their attribute bonus is applied. If a character is proficient in a relavent skill, they rll an additional d6 and add the result.  
If it is a save, the character's heroism is also applied.  
If the result is equal to or greater than the Difficulty Value (or DV), the check/save success. Otherwise it is a failure.

#### CRITICAL SUCCESS AND FAILURE
If a check/save is at least half again the required number to succeed, it is a critical success. If a check/save is ever half (or less) the number required to fail, it is a critical failure.

#### ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE
Anytime a die (or dice) roll is made with advantage, it is rolled again and the result best for the roller of that die/dice is used. If a die (or dice) is rolled with disadvantage, an additional roll is made and the result which is worse for the roller of the die is used.  
If a roll is affected by both advantage and disadvantage, and it is an equal number of instances of advantage and disadvantage, no additional die is rolled. If there is a greater number of instances of advantage or disadvantage applied to a die roll, simply treat it as being affected by that.

#### OPPOSED CHECKS
An opposed check requires two opponents each roll 3d6 and add their appropriate attribute to their result. If one side is greater than the other, they have a success while the opponent has a failure. If one of the opponents has a total value more than one and a half times their opponent, they enjoy a critical success and their opponent suffers a critical failure. Sometimes it will be up to the narrator if a critical success/failure has any outstanding effect.

#### SIZE CATEGORY
All creatures have a size category. For the purposes of trampling, these size categories can be used to determine if a creature is small enough to be trampled. A narrator may find other uses for these size categories as well. A narrator is free to simply use their judgement when deciding trampling though.

Size Caes are as follows:  
Jormungous  
Titanous  
Huge  
Great  
Large  
Medium  
Small  
Diminutive
