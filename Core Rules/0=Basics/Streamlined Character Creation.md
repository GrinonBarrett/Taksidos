### Streamlined Character Generation
While more advanced rules are included, this method should be used for a player's first character. It is always good for a narrator to help a player make their character. 

#### GENERATING ABILITY SCORES
You have 80 points to distribute among your attributes scores as you choose. To improve any attribute beyond 12, 2 points must be spent per per point of ability score. For example, to have an ability score of 13 costs 14 points whilst an 18 costs 24.

After you have assinged those points, choose two of your attributes. Both are increased by 1.

#### BACKGROUND
Think of what your character did with their life before the start of the game. Pick four skills to represent this. If you can't think of enough skills, its fine. You could use the rest to choose skills you think will be useful with the class you choose.

#### LANGUAGES
You are automatically competent in the Common tongue, but may also choose another language to learn.

#### EDGE
You have an edge over most normal humans. 

• **Adept**. Select a skill, Anytime you use that skill to perform a check (whether you are proficient or not), you gain a +2 bonus to that check. 

• **Grand Feat**. When performing a check or save, you may choose to roll 2d8 + your heroism + your attribute bonus. You must perform a rest before doing so again.

• **Swole**. Your hitpoints increase by 1.

• **Tongue and Cheek**. Select two languages. You learn both.

• **Weapon Competency**. Select a weapon type. You gain a +1 bonus to all attacks made with the selected weapon type. 

#### DETERMINING CLASS
Each player chooses a character class when making their character. This provides the character with several advantages as they grow including the possibility of a class skill. If a class offers a class skill from a list, you must select one such option if able. If you are already proficient in the listed skills, you may instead choose any skill of your liking.

Once a class is chosen, it cannot be changed. 

#### DETAILS
Don't forget to figure out some details about your character. How tall are they? How old? How much do they weigh? What are their aspirations?

Your creature type, size category, movement speeds, wound chart, and Potential is that of a Manfolk.

#### GEAR
The narrator may give you a package of gear and will also give you an amount of starting cash to begin the game with.
