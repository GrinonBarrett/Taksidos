#### CONDITIONS

If multiple conditions would have a creature choose to forfeit their turn during an action phase, it forgoes turns during both phases.

##### Archblight
Archblight is a condition not easily obtained and not easily lost. Multiple instances of archblight can be accrued. One afflicted by spellblifht suffers a -1 to spellchecks, counterspell checks, and saves against magic. The only way it xan be removed, is to be lost like a wound by a magical effect which restores wounds.

##### Dazed
The creature may perform only a single movement, a single rotation, and must forfeit its turn during either action phase. Additionally, there is a 50% chance it simply loses its reaction when trying to use a reaction.

##### Fatigue
A character suffering from fatigue (also called exhaustion) will endure penalties based on the level of their fatigue. A player suffers the penalties for their current level and all previous levels. Proper rest can reduce a character’s fatigue. Each level of fatigue incurs a -2 penalty to all attributes. 
If a character has 3 or more levels of exhaustion when the fatigue is applied, they must succeed a [Fort] save or immediately be dropped to 0 hitpoints.  
If a character has 5 level of exhaustion and accrues any more, they die.

##### Frozen
A frozen creature can only be so by the effect of magic. The creature is encased in ice, frozen to the core. A frozen creature is subject to the following:

  • It exists in a state of stasis, incapable of doing anything (including breathing).

  • It is not required to eat, breathe, etc.

  • Ignores the effects of cold, necrotic, psychic and toxic attacks.

  • Not subject to incapaitation.

  • Is not afected by wounds at the time of occurance, but will still receive them and their effects when thawed.

  • Does not lose hitpoints as a result of attacks.

  • Is also Immobile.

##### Hemorrhage
Also called bleeding. A hemorrhaging character has suffered terrible bleeding externally or internally. At the end of each round, a [Fort] or [Will] save (whichever is lower) must be made with a DV equal to 5 + the number of rounds the character has been hemorrhaging. A success yields no effect. A failure causes the player to immediately incur a point of inebriation. A critical failure causes the player to roll a d4 and apply the result
 * 1: Character takes on a level of exhaustion.
 * 2: Character must make an incapcitation save.
 * 3: Character stumbles, becoming prone. If they were already prone, they instead are made vulnerable.
 * 4: They lose a hitpoint. If they have no hitpoints remaining, they are dazed for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. This is cumulative with future results.

3 critical successes will end the condition, as can proper medical care. An effect which could restore a wound can remove this conditition instead.

Multiple instances of hemorrhage can be applied to the same creature.
