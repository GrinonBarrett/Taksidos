#### Weapon Training
While every player character is considered to be competent with any weapon they get their hands on, a character can train to become more proficient with such weapons. This takes three forms. The first form, "proficiency", allows you to choose one of the following:  
1) It provides a +1 bonus to attack rolls.  
2) If you inflict a wound, you may alter the die roll result of the wound die by 1 in either direction. This is before it is determined if it is a Defender's Choice.
 
The second form, "specialization", allows you to apply both effects.

The third form, "expertise", also grants a +4 bonus to your attack for the purpose of determining a critical hit.

You must choose which benefits are to be applied before rolling the attack.

A character can gain training in unarmed attacks, which benefits any unarmed attacks they possess.
