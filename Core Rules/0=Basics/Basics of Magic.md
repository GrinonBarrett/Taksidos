## BASICS OF MAGIC

Each character is capable of using magic. Magic occurs in the form of spells. To cast a spell, the character must have learned the spell and performs a spellcheck. The spell check result must be at least as high as the spell's requirement. The requirement is based on the tier. You roll a d20. If you succeed, you cast the spell. Spells have a minimum tier. The spell cannot be cast lower than that tier. The difficulty of casting a spell is 7 + triple its tier. To make a save against a spell, you must exceed double the spell's tier and the points of success by the caster on their spellcheck.

You add your heorism to your spell check.

A successful check imposes a point of spell-sickness, though a critical success does not. Failure results in no effect and also imposes a point of spell sickness per spell tier. In the event of a critical failure, the spell dictates what can happen, in addition to receiving the spell-sickness for failure.  

#### Casting Time
A character must spend a number of actions (or units of time) to cast the spell. Once the spell is cast, it occurs at the end of the phase.

#### Casting Using Reaction
Some spells let you use a reaction to cast it. This does not count as "reflexive casting" (see SPECIAl ACTIONS). You cannot cast such a a spell using your reaction during the same phase you cast another spell. A spell cast using a reaction occurs immediately.

### SPELL-SICKNESS  
Spell sickness is a cumulative -1 penalty to casting spells for an hour. If this penalty builds up, it is simply reduced by 1 per hour, instead of each individual point being lost after an hour.

### Learning  Spells
Each character is capable of learning the inner workings of a spell by devoting time to study it. With the proper learning materials, it will take a number of total hours of study equal to 5 + the minumum tier of the spell- the sum of which is multiplied by the minimum tier of the spell. If only incomplete materials are available, it will take at least 8 hours a day for a number of days equal to 1d4+6 per tier of the spell. Each week that passes without continuing the study from incomplete materials will cause a day of regression in your progress.

#### Benefits of Knowing a Spell
A character that is familiar with a spell gets a +1 bonus to their defense against that spell and a +2 to any saves against it. They may also cast the spell using any means of spellcasting available to them. Additionally, your character will be able to recognize the spell, even if it is a twisted variation of the spell.

#### Wyrdings
Each character is capable of casting a spell through a technique called "wyrding" without the use of an item or class feature. All characters operated by players are capable of doing this regardless of class. This uses all the standard rules as listed here.

#### Alternative Spellcasting Methods
Some classes are capable of casting spells using alternative methods. Those methods follow the same rules here except where noted by that method's rules text.

### Counterspell
A character may use their reaction to begin the counter spell process. If they do, the casting time of the spell is immediately increased by 1 action† and the two will be locked in a battle of magical proficiency. Each side attempts an opposed counter-spell check. This check does not benefit from any specific attribute unless a feature dictates otherwise. If the caster has a success, they are not further affected by the counterspell. If the caster has a failure, their remaining casting time is increased by half (minimum of 1 action) and they endure a point of Spell-Sickness. If the caster has a critical success, they completely ignore any further effects of the counterspell attempt and imposes Spell-Sickness against the one attempting to counterspell equal to the spell's tier. If the caster has a critical failure, their spell is completely lost and they receive a point of Spell-Sickness.  
A creature has a penalty to their counter-spell check equal to their Spell-Sickness.

† A spell with a casting time of a single reaction does not have its casting time increased this way, although a failure by the caster with their counterspell check will yield no effect by the spell.
