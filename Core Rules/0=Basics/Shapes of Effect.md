Sometimes an effect will affect an area rather than a specific target.

##### Cone
A cone extends out from the point of origin and will alway expand to be as tall and wide as the distance from the point of origin.

##### Fan
A fan extends directly from the point point of origin. It is considered a 2 dimensional plane. Its width expands out from the point of origin and is as wide as the distance from the point of origin.

##### Hemisphere
Like a sphere, split in half.

##### Inverted Cone
Functions as a cone, however the center of the base exists at the point of origin with the shape tapering out as it extends from the point of origin.

##### Line
A line extends directly from the point of origin. A line always has its length, height, and width defined by the effect.

##### Semifan
Like a fan, but the width of any point is always half of the length from the point of origin.

#### Mikrofan
Like a fan, but the width of any point is always one-third of its length.

##### Sphere
A sphere extends from the point of origin in all directions out to the distance dictated by the effect.
