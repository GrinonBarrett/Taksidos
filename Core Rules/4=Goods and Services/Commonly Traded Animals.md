##### Common Animals

| Animal | Cost | Purpose | Food/Fluid per day | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|--------------------|-------|
|       |      |              |                    |                    |
| Caui | $2,600 | Cattle | **17/68** | Also provides some value in egg laying and down, which makes them a bit more valuable for their weight. They are known to be difficult to handle though. |
| Draftsnail | $3,400 | Beast of Burden | **7/165** | Used almost exclusively in the Meolasine Empire. They're not very strong compared to other creatures used for draughtwork, but they are docile and inexpensive to maintain. |
| Mule | $4,000 | Beast of Burden | **20/80** | A cross between donkey and horse. It is the perfect beast of burden. |
