### Magical Services
Magical services are grouped by the basic nature of its function, rather than a particular associated talent.

#### Auspicy
The following services are each a form of divination which are considered imperfect. Many are affected by the medium through which the divination occurs. Because these magics are easier to perform, they are far less expensive. One that performs this service may be called and an Auspice, Auspex, Ergefsuh, or rarely a Diviner.

##### Augery
The practitioner seeks to gain guidance by interpreting the movements of birds. General yes/no sorts of answers can be scried, as well as the intensity of an answer. A general direction may also be obtained from a sharp movement of a leading bird. Used for general omens typically, this service can set one back at least $400, but some charge as much as $1,700 depending on the nature of the request and the status of the auspex.

##### Pyropropheticism
The practitioner seeks to divine a result by interpreting the color, direction, and scent of the smoke. Typically, a scenario is proposed regarding the future or an event. What is revealed is whether the result will be good/bad or as intended and to what degree it is so.  
An average session can cause the player to part with $500-$2,000, depending on the practitioner and the nature of their request.

One can expect general guidance as to the direction one should go in when it comes to decision making. Occasionally, extremely intense feedback can be obtained. In these cases, the auspex may actually get a vision and more than they bargained for.

##### Haruspicy
The practitioner slaughters an animal and reads signs through the organs and remains. A sick animal will greatly corrupt the result. Average cost is two and a half times that of the animal slaughtered.
