## CARRYING CAPACITY
Carrying capacity reflects how much weight you can wear for travel. You have 3 weight load levels- light, moderate, and heavy.  
Your light load is up to a number of pounds equal to your [Body] and places no effect on you.  
Your moderate load limit is double your [Body] in pounds and will not cause you to suffer a level of exhaustion at the end of an adventuring day if you must bear it for any lengthy duration, but will slow down your pace some.  
A heavy load is 2.5 pounds multiplied by your [Body]. You will suffer a level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

### Burdensome Loads
You may carry up to 4 times your [Body] in weight, but will suffer a level of exhaustion after 4 hours and are prone for the entire time your bear that load.

### Marching Loads
A character may carry up to 10 times their [Body] in weight, but suffer all of the effects of a burdensome load and are considered vulnerable for that time and will incur their fatigue every 3 hours their movement speed is also reduced by a sixth (or .5 feet for every yard).

### Lifting
If attempting to lift an object as a skill check, the DV is 1 per 1.5 pounds of weight the object is. Certain difficult to manage items could be up to 4 per pound. Multiple individuals can contribute to this.

### Wearing Armor
Armor is designed to reduce the impact of the weight on the wearer. Treat the weight of armor as half (for the wearer) while worn unless otherwise noted.
