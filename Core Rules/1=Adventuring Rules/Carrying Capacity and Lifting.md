## CARRYING CAPACITY
Carrying capacity reflects how much weight you can wear for travel. You have 3 weight load levels- light, moderate, and heavy. Your light load is up to a number of pounds equal to your [Body] and places no effect on you. Your moderate load limit is double your [Body] in pounds and will not cause you to suffer a level of exhaustion at the end of an adventuring day if you must bear it for any lengthy duration, but will slow down your pace some. A heavy load is 2.5 pounds multiplied by your [Body]. You will suffer a level of exhaustion at the end of the day.
