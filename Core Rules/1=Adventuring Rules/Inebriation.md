### INEBRIATION
Characters are likely going to drink. Even if they don't, some substances can create similarly debilitating effects to alcohol (not to mention the effects of wildling magic). Each point of inebriation can last for 1d12 + 1d8 minutes. This is individual to each point of inebriation. When the time expires from the inebriation point, each die is reduced by 1 level each. Once a die is reduced below 1, it is no longer rolled. When both dice are lost from the inebriation, that point of inebriation is lost.  
A point of inebriation does not begin for a number of minutes equal to your [Fort] bonus + 1.  
When your inebriation reachs half of your [Fort] score, you are obtunded. When your inebriation is 3/4 of your [Fort] score, you are stuporous. When your inebriation reaches your [Fort] score, you are incapacitated.
