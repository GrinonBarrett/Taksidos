## REACTIONS FROM OTHERS
Whenever the players encounter other people, it may be fit to determine how they react to the player. Roll a die 20 to determine the type of reaction (sometime called the "emotion" of the encounter) and a d4 is rolled to determine the intesnity. A result of 4 on the d4 makes the fellow indifferent, causing no meaningful effect.

Hostility (1-2 or 19-20)  
    1) Is not fighting outright, but will be oppositional to the party.  
    2) Not actively attacking the players, but a bad remark can change that.  
    3) Immediate Combat with the intent of doing harm to the party.

Fear (3-4 or 17-18)  
    1) Apprehensive to dealing with the party.  
    2) Will go out of their way to avoid the party.  
    3) Will attempt to avoid the party entirely, but if engaged will strike out of fear (having disadvantage) to produce an opportunity to escape.

Amicability (5-7 or 14-16)  
    1) You get "the nod" and go about your day.  
    2) You get a friendly greeting.  
    3) If it is a person, they may offer a piece of friendly advice (like "Mind the ruts ahead, they'll stop your wagon if you aren't careful"). If it is a less sapient creature, it will perform some equally freindly gesture as appropriate to the creature.

Greed (8 or 13)  
    1) They would like to offer some form of trade or other transaction.  
    2) They will demand your money and any obvious (and easily sold) goods from you.  Alternatively, they might appear to be helpful but instead lead you to a trap.  
    3) They will attack you and loot the bodies. They are very much likely to retreat if you can turn the tables on them.

Curiosity (9-11)  
    1) You get a funny look.  
    2) You get a greeting and a lot of questions.  
    3) They will begin to follow you, stealthily or otherwise.
