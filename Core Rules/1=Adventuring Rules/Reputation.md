## REPUTATION
A character with a reputation has a chance of being noticed in a social encounter when their identity is revealed. A d12 is rolled for each type of reputation held by the character. If the result is lower, they recognize the character for it.

The reaction's d20 result should be modified a number of points equal to the difference of the d12 and the reputation towards the appropriate emotion. If the result was already of the appropriate emotion, it should instead increase the intensity by one-third of the difference.

### Special Reputation
A special reputation is extremely niche and not checked for every encounter, but simply when interacting with some very particular individuals. It should be used to influence the nuance of an encounter rather than the general emotion.
