#### SIZE CATEGORY
All creatures have a size category. For the purposes of trampling, these size categories can be used to determine if a creature is small enough to be trampled. A narrator may find other uses for these size categories as well. A narrator is free to simply use their judgement when deciding trampling though.

Size Categories are as follows:  
Jormungous  
Titanous  
Huge  
Great  
Large  
Medium  
Small  
Diminutive
