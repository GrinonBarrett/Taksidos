#### SIZE CATEGORY
All creatures have a size category. For the purposes of trampling, these size categories can be used to determine if a creature is small enough to be trampled. A narrator may find other uses for these size categories as well. A narrator is free to simply use their judgement when deciding trampling though.

Size Categories are as follows:  
Insurmountable (larger than a mile)
Jormungous  (up to a mile)
Titanous  (up to 1000 feet)
Huge  (up to 250 feet)
Great  (roughly 24-50 feet in length)
Large  (roughly 7 - 24 feet)
Medium  (roughly 3-7 feet)
Small (roughly between 1-3 feet)  
Diminutive (smaller than small)
