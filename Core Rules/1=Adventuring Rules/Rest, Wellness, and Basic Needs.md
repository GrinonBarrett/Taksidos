## REST
There are three forms of rest;  
Short rests, long rests, and full rests.

If you resting would transition from one stage to the next, you only gain the benefit of the greater rest. A character can go a day with only a short rest, but will require long or full rest for any day afterwards or be subject to a level of fatigue.

A short rest provides little benefit itself, but can restore function of some special features and can prevent fatigue from marching. A short rest represents about half an hour to an hour of downtime. One can eat during this time but should not be actively engaged in any task of demand.  

A long rest allows a fed and hydrated individual to restore a hitpoint and a level of fatigue. This represents roughly 8-9 hours including sleep.

A full rest allows a fed and hydrated character to recover half of their missing hitpoints and a level of fatigue. Additionally, simply taking this rest recovers a single level of fatigue and a single hitpoint (after the benfits of being well fed and hydrated). This requires a full 24 hours of uninterrupted rest.
