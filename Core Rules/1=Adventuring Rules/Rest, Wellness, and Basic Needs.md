## REST
There are three forms of rest;  
Short rests, long rests, and full rests.

If you resting would transition from one stage to the next, you only gain the benefit of the greater rest. A character can go a day with only a short rest, but will require long or full rest for any day afterwards or be subject to a level of fatigue.

A short rest provides little benefit itself, but can restore function of some special features and can prevent fatigue from marching. A short rest represents about half an hour to an hour of downtime. One can eat during this time but should not be actively engaged in any task of demand.  

A long rest allows a fed and hydrated individual to restore a hitpoint and a level of fatigue. This represents roughly 8-9 hours including sleep.

A full rest allows a fed and hydrated character to recover half of their missing hitpoints and a level of fatigue. Additionally, simply taking this rest recovers a single level of fatigue and a single hitpoint (after the benfits of being well fed and hydrated). This requires a full 24 hours of uninterrupted rest.

## FOOD, WATER, AND SURVIVAL
While rules for the cost of food on the road is given, they are only an average of the cost of eating on the road. Included herein are more detailed rules for food, drink, and deprivation of such things.

### Food
It is recommended that adventurers eat about 4 servings per day. If an adventurer is not marching the whole day or is otherwise not exerting themselves heavily, only 3 servings should be neccessary. Once a week, an adventurer could get by with only 2 servings without ill effect (aside from being a bit grumpy). A diet can consist of no more than two-thirds of one food type. A diet incorporating more than 1 serving of salted food per day can lead to health problems. An adventurer can eat up to 2 servings more per day without ill effect in general, save for a little weight gain perhaps.  
After 3 days of improper eating, the adventurer takes on a level of exhaustion. After a week, this is increased to two. Each week beyond that will incur another level of exhaustion. This exhaustion cannot be recovered by resting.

**Legumes**, $3.4 per lb.  
A shelf stable dry good. These require water or some other cooking method to take full advantage of. A single lb can provide 2.5 servings so long as another food type is consumed with it. Part of this reflects the addition of the cooking medium.

**Leafy Produce**, $4.4 per lb.  
Only good for 1d4+1 days, at which point it will become spoiling produce. These can typically be eaten as it but some varieties (such as cabbage), may be cooked. A pound will provide about 2 servings.

Good for 4d4+10 days. They can be prepared in a variety of methods. While most varieties are not enjoyable raw, some can be tolerable.

The value of onions has a surprising amount of fluctuation to it, being up to 1d20+1d12 percent above or below the listed price.

**Spoiling Produce**, $2 per lb.  
Only good for 1d2 days. Good is a generous term for this stuff. It's not completely bad, but it is more likely to carry with it the chance of bringing sickness to its consumer. If consumed for consecutive days, a [Fort] save must be made or the consumer will contract some foodborne malady. If multiple portions were consumed, each portion beyond the first brings with it an instance of disadvantage and a -1 penalty. Anything after this stage is no longer food. A pound provides 2 servings.

#### Proteins
You may only benefit from 2 total servings of protein per day. Nuts count as protein, but the value of them is included in the trade goods.
