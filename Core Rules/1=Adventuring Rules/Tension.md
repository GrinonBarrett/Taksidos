### TENSION
Adventuring is stressful. It takes its toll physically, mentally, and emotionally. Anytime the character critically fails a check/save, fails a save against a fear-related effect, or is affected by a critical hit, they receive a point of tension. They may also receive a point of tension for each day beyond the first without rest. Once their tension equal or exceeds their level, they are subject to the Oramous condition.  

If a character's gains a point of tension while already having twice as much as their level, they must perform an incapaitation save or die immediately.

A short rest can reduce tension by 1. A long rest can reduce your current amount by 1d4. A full rest can reduce it by 1d6+1d4.
