## FALLING
If a creature falls from a particular distance, they will likely receive some amount of damage in the form of force, crushing, or unlisted attacks (narrator's choice). If a creature lands on a particular type of object, the damage can be adjusted accordingly (a spike dealing piercing or blade cutting).

For the sake of simplicity, weâ€™ll say all creatures are affected the same way by forces such as drag. Creatures fall roughly at a rate of 15 yards per round (or 3.75 yards per phase). Creatures with a flying speed may reduce this speed by an amount equal to their flying speed. Levitating creatures are, of course, able to stop. The severity of what is inflicted to a creature will depend on the distance traveled:  
2-3 yards = 1 club attack  
3-5 yards = 1 attack with a +1 bonus  
6-9 yards = 1 attack with a +2 bonus  
10-14 yards = 1 attack with a +2 bonus, then another attack  
15-20 yards = 1 attack with a +2 bonus, then another attack with a +1 bonus  
21-25 yards = 2 attacks with a +2 bonus, another attack with a +1 bonus, then another attack  
26-30 yards = 2 attacks with a +3 bonus, another attack with a +2 bonus, then another attack  
31-40 yards = 2 attacks with a +3 bonus, another 2 attacks with a +2 bonus, then another attack  
41-50 yards = 3 attacks with a +3 bonus, then another 3 attacks with a +2 bonus  

For every 5 yards beyond 50, add another attack with a +1 bonus for each additional attack earned beyond the 50 yard mark.  
A character may perform an athletics check as a reaction to reduce the fall, in feet, by the total of the result. The character will be prone until the end of the next round.

### Knockback
If a creature would be knocked away by an effect, but hits an obstacle that would prevent it from continuing, it will receive damage like it is falling- with the distance "fallen" being equal to the remaining knockback distance.
