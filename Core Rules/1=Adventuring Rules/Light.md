## LIGHT
Light comes in four levels;  
Bright, Fair, Dim, and Darkness.  
    • **Bright light** is more than most creatures are used to and confers a -1 penalty to all checks, saves, and attack rolls relying on sight made in it. Attempting to stare into the sun in the morning is comparable to bright light’s effect.  
    • **Fair light** represents the light most creatures are accustom to during the day, such as natural sunlight.   
    • **Dim light** is barely enough light for most diurnal creatures to operate by, causing a -2 penalty to all checks relying on sight and attack rolls made in it.  
    • **Darkness** puts a creature at disadvantage on all rolls relying on sight in addition to a -2 penalty.

Some creatures react to light differently.
