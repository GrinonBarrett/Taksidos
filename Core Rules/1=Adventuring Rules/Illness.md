## ILLNESS
During the course of an adventure, it is entirely possible for a character to become the carrier of a disease of some sort. At the end of each adventuring day, if the adventurers have been exposed to a disease, they roll a number of [Fort] saves based on their total exposure to the disease. If they fail one, they are a carrier. If they fail two, they sick. A carrier can still pass on a sickness even if they don't experience it, at least for the duration of the incubation time. Anyone afflicted by the effects of a disease is still treated as a carrier and not just an infected individual.

A roll need only be made for a point of exposure that is relevent. A creature which does not need to breathe probably isn't catching a respitory disease. Realisitically, it can be more complex than that but we are going to draw the line on game crunch here.

### Points of Exposure
Some points of exposure also inccur a penalty to the save.  
* Breathed in the air of a carrier.
* Exchanged fluids in some way with a carrier (such as eating/drinking after one, intimate contact, etc), -1
* Prolonged physical contact with a carrier.
* Consumed flesh/body of a carrier (cooked or raw), -2.
* Breathed in the air of an infected.
* Made physical contact with an infected.
* Exchanged fluids with an infected, -1.
* Rested within 10 yards of an infected.
* Prolonged physical contact with an infected, -1.
* Ate the raw flesh/body of an infected, -4
* Ate the cooked flesh/body of an infected, -3.
* Held an item touched by an infected.

Incubation time is how long it takes from contact to onset of symptoms.

Notes

**Mad Fox Disease**  
*Magical* 
**Means of Contagion**: Physical contact, respitory, fluid contact
DV 8  
**Incubation**: 3d4 days 
**Average Duration**: 2d12+26 years  
**Effect**: Foxes will allows be 1 degree more hostile to the infected, unless they themselves are also infected. Additionally, every 1d10+7 days, they will experience a fit of seizures every 1d4 hours. This lessens their rest by one degree, causes their [Rflx] bonus to be treated as 0, their [Rflx] bonus to be treated as one-third, and a *13% chance to transform into a rabbid fox on the anniversary of their contracting the disease. This transformation takes a number of minutes equal to the victi's [Body] score multiplied by 1 plus the diffence in size categories between itself and a fox. During this transformation, the horrifically intense nature of the phsyical transmutation and the pain leave the victim dazed, prone, and vulnerable. After the transformation is complete, the victim will remain dazed, prone, and vulnerable for an equal number of minutes divided by the lower of the victim's previous [Will] or [Fort] score plus the number of times it has transformed this way. After a number of hours equal to 1d10 plus the difference in size category between the fox form and the creature's form, it will transform back into its original form, in a process akin to its transition to fox form*.
**Notes**: Often, patient zero is bitten by a fox afflicted by a curse which affects the mind. It is also said that eating a fox could do this. A creature transformed by this disease which would qualify for damaging armor instead produces another point of exposure to the one bitten. A fox never experiences the typical symptoms of this disease and instead finds itself making irrational decisions more often.

###### Recommended DV for something as simple as the common cold should be 4-6. Modern flu should be 7-9. Historicaly accurate flus should be in the 12-15 range. I need to add some proper diseases to the game.
