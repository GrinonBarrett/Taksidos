#### Weapon Training
While every player character is considered to be competent with any weapon they get their hands on, a character can train to become more proficient with such weapons. This takes two forms. The first form, **proficiency**, allows you to choose one of the follwing:  
1) It provides a +1 bonus to attack rolls.  
2) If you inflict a wound, you may alter the die roll result of the wound die by 1 in either direction.

The second form, **specialization**, allows you to do both.
