| # | ? | Name              | Effect                                                         | Notes |

|   | ¤ | Awesome           | +2 defense against all forms of exotic attacks.                |       |
|   | ± | Glassy            | +1 defense against all forms of exotic attacks. +1 defense against magical attacks. Anytime the armor is damaged, it is further damaged 1d2 steps. For each step beyond the armor being ruined, the wear receives an unlisted attack as the armor breaks and harms them.   |       |
|   | ¤ | Rugged            | Armor cannot become ruined by having its last point of damage being received from a non-magical attack. |       |
|   | × | Bleeding          | Wearer is always hemorraging. Roll again for another prefix to attach to the armor. If Bleeding is the next result, there is no additional prefix.                                                                                                                         | Use the hemorrhage condition even if playing with the "Bloodied" optional condition. |
|   | ¤ | Shining           | As an action, *you may have the armor produce light like a torch*.  It does so until removed, you spend an action to suprress it, or the armor is damaged in some way. |       |
|   |   | Horrifying        | Anytime an attack against the armor could qualify as a critical hit, the source of that attack and anything other than the wearer within 2 yards of the armor must succeed a [Will] save or become afraid of the wearer, using their move and actions to gain as much distance as possible. The DV is equal to the attack roll and lasts for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure.                                                                                     |       |
|   |   | Glowing           | Produces dim light reaching out 5 yards while worn.            |       |
|   |   | Dim               | All light within 3 yards of the armor is reduced by one level. |       |
