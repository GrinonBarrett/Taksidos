|   |   | Angry             | Anytime you are wounded or an attack against you is a critical failure, you enter a battlerage trance- just like a Berserk. |       |
|   | ¤ | Awesome           | +2 defense against all forms of exotic attacks.                |       |
|   | × | Bleeding          | Wearer is always hemorraging. Roll again for another prefix to attach to the armor. If Bleeding is the next result, there is no additional prefix.                                                                                                                         | Use the hemorrhage condition even if playing with the "Bloodied" optional condition. |
|   |   | Clumsy            | Anytime you critically fail a roll or the armor is damaged, you are made prone.                                   |       |
|   | ± | Dim               | All light within 3 yards of the armor is reduced by one level. |       |

|   | ± | Glassy            | +1 defense against all forms of exotic attacks. +1 defense against magical attacks. Anytime the armor is damaged, it is further damaged 1d2 steps.

|   | ¤ | Glowing           | Produces dim light reaching out 5 yards while worn.            |       |
|   | × | Horrifying        | Anytime an attack against the armor could qualify as a critical hit, the source of that attack and anything other than the wearer within 2 yards of the armor must succeed a [Will] save or become afraid of the wearer, using their move and actions to gain as much distance as possible.

|   | ¤ | Rugged            | Armor cannot become ruined by having its last point of damage being received from a non-magical attack. |       |
|   | ¤ | Shining           | As an action, you may have the armor produce light like a torch.  It does so until removed, you spend an action to suprress it, or the armor is damaged in some way. |       |
