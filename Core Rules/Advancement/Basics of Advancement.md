## ADVANCEMENT

### Experience
It is recommended that each character receives 2 experience points at the conclusion of any tale. If a character was only available for part of the adventure, they should receive at least 1 of those 2 experience points. At the end of any gaming session, the players should also vote as to which character they felt was their favorite. The exact criteria for this could be anything (best in combat, most interesting dialogue, most improvement by the player over the previous session, etc). The character with the most votes gains an additional experience point.

### Leveling
The amount of experience required to reach a level is equal to your current level plus the next, or as follows:

Level Experience Total  
  2 =	3  
  3 =	8 (level 2 + 5)  
  4 =	15 (level 3 + 7)  
  5 =	24 (level 4 + 9)  
  6 =	35 (level 5 + 11)  
  7 =	48 (level 6 + 13)  
  8 =	63 (level 7 + 15)  
  9 =	80 (level 8 + 17)  
  10 =	99 (level 9 + 19)  

If the character has the Quick Study feature, they use the following instead;
Level	Experience Total  
  2 =	3  
  3 =	6  
  4 =	12  
  5 =	18  
  6 =	26  
  7 =	36  
  8 =	48  
  9 =	60  
  10 =	75  

### Attribute Improvements
Anytime a character gains a new level, they may improve an attribute of their choice. They cannot improve an ability beyond 18 this way, unless otherwise noted.

Additionally, most classes have levels which feature an "Attribute Improvement". During these levels, you may choose an additional attibute to improve.
