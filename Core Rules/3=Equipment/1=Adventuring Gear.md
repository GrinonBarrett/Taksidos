#### Casamirian Device  
A casamirian device is used for seeing through another casamirian device. A casamirian device can only provide as much vision as a normal eye might, but some devices can be rotated or moved in some way. So long as one is familiar with a casamirian device, they can gaze through it using another. The level of familiarity one must have to gaze through such an item is like that of a focus.

  **• Casamirian Sphere, $10,000, 10 lb.**  
This clear quartz orb can be used to *see through another casamirian device* if the user is competent with Spellcraft. This sphere requires three total hits to destroy. Sonic and Psychic attacks against it have advantage. It is immune to necrotic, radiant, and toxic sources of damage. Acid, fire, and cold attacks against the sphere have disadvantage.

###### More casamirian devices to come.

**Chip Log, $160, 60 lb.**  
A length of rope with knots tied at specific intervals. It is attached to a buoyant board at the end. The board is thrown overboard and the number of knots is counted to determine the ship’s speed.

**Crassine Charm, $1,800, .5 lb.**  
This charm can take many forms, but it is usually fashioned in such a way as to appear as a piece of large jewelry, such as an amulet. This charm must become attuned to its wearer by being on their person for 40 days. Once attuned it can be activated on one of 3 frequencies; “Positive”, “Negative”, and “Neutral”. Certain items are also attuned to the wearer to become compatible with the charm, usually by keeping it on their person for 72 hours. Once such an item is attuned, it is given one of the above listed frequencies. Such an item is activated when the charm is set to that frequency. The activation of the charm requires 1 action. All uses of the crassine charm are magical effects.

 **• Crassine Compass, $500, 1 lb.**  
This compass functions identically to a pivot compass, _except that it has a second needle that will point to an active crassine charm attuned to the same individual that is currently active on the attuned frequency_. If no such charm is set to the same frequency, the second needle hides from sight.
This compass is attuned by remaining on the individual’s person for 40 days. It can then be locked to not change attunement. A simple mechanism allows the lock to be disengaged.

 **• Crassine Flask, $500, negligible plus liquid.**  
This flask must be attuned before it can be used with a crassine charm by being held on their person for 10 days. Once attuned and set to a frequency, _the flask opens upon activation if closed, or vice versa_. It cannot be opened/closed by another means short of a DV 30 [Body] check. It can always hold 1 dose of any magical concoction, or 1 litre of water.

 **• Crassine Lock, $3,000, 1 lb.**  
This lock cannot function until attuned. Once attuned, _it is opened/closed upon activation_. The lock allows no form of mechanical interaction to be “picked”. It can be destroyed with 20 points of damage, but it ignores the first 8 points of damage dealt from a single source. It is not affected by toxic or psychic damage.

#### Rope
Rope is purchased in increments of yard. Once cut, the rope can't typically be rejoined. It has a strength value which determines the maximum weight of a standing load it can bear. If the intended load is to be jostled or produce a sudden shock to the rope, treat the strength as half. When a rope is damaged in any way, its strength is reduced to one third. Rope is not affected by toxic damage, psychic damage, or unarmed attacks.
