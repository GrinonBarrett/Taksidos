### SHIELDS
Shields provide some passive benefit. They can also grant a bonus to defense when used to block. If a creature has multiple shields and use the Block reaction, they may block with multiple shields, but each shield must block a different attack.

Special features  

**Buckler**, $105, 2.25 lb.  
+0  
A small piece affixed to the forearm. It does not provide much protection, serving a better job of parrying than anything else.  
While attached to the forearm, it does not prevent the use of a hand, but also does not provide protection during any phase you act with that limb. It can also be used to turn your unarmed attack into a weapon attack. It still inflicts a bare attack.

**Rondache**, $130, 4 lb.  
+1  
A simple shield. The rondache finds success in the hands of many adventurers.   

**Parmula**, $250, 7.5 lb.  
+2  
Shield of choice for the Lazine military, the parmula is a reliable source of cover.
Requires 11 or greater [Body] to use.  

**Tower**, $400, 13 lb.  
+0  
Intended to provide as much cover from missiles as possible while also being practical in a melee, the tower shield is famously used in formation where its cover can be maximized.  
Requires 13 or greater [Body] to use. Does not provide a set bonus when blocking, instead it provides cover. If the shield is used to block for someone that does not have cover, it provides half cover. If they already have cover, it instead provides an additional one-quarter cover.  
WHen used to block for yourself, it is always treated as giving you an additional quarter of coverage.
