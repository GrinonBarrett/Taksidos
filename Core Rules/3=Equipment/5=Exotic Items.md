### EXOTIC ITEMS
Here are some of the more magical items one may come across. 

**Boutava's Beneficial Bourbon**, $125 per bottle, 3 lbs.  
The bottle includes a paper adhered to its body, 
> "When the eldritch horrors get rough with your body, reach for the smooth taste that replenishes your soul. With 17 essential vitamins and minerals and a proprietary blend of fine spirits and botanicals, our cask strength panacea can be used by adventurers of any experience with complete confidence. While others may sell your oil d'naga blends with subpar liquors, we have taken oaths to 3 different gods of festivities to ensure our employees never falter in delivering to you the premium product you demand for your active lifestle. When you are close to joining the spirits, choose the spirits more professionals reach for."

A bottle contains 25 servings, which are each capable of giving a character 2 points of enebriation. A character gains no hydration from this and will infact require an additional serving of water for every 3 servings they partake in. Whether taken orally or topically, this can provide a 1d4 *(+1 as an effect of its latent magics)* bonus to a medicine check to the one it is administered. Additionally, there is a % chance equal to the number of servings they take that they will recover a single hitpoint.

**Coldon's Powdered Ale**, $200 per serving, neg.  
_This powder can turn half a serving of water into a serving of ale by sprinkling it into the water and giving it the slightest stir_. We don't know how this works anymore than you, but we wish it wasn't so expensive. Roll a d20. The narrator secretly chooses a number. If the die result matches the number, the ale will taste awful. Otherwise, it is rather servicable.

**Dust of Disjunction**, $1,000, neg.  
Represents one “dose”. This powder is capable of temporarily rendering magic inert. An object or creature with a dose of this sprinkled over them has its magical features become negated while covered. Larger creatures/objects may require more doses, but a single dose can be sprinkled on a person or a 4" by 4" square. This lasts so long as the object is covered, but the dust itself usually becomes inert after it has been removed or itself rendered so by something else. The dust is water soluble and becomes inert when absorbed by any liquid, but a single dose will ruin a potion.
If this dust is mixed into another magical dust or powder, it will likely render it inert as well.  
Not recommended to handle without protection, but not harmful to the touch.

**Paetur's Stew Jar**, $250 , 1.75 lb.  
An amber colored jar, sealed with grey-green wax. The contents look like broth with shreds of some disintegrating material. Opening the jar _instead reveals its true contents to be a hot and hardy stew with plenty of veggies, beef, and venison_. The stew is fresh upon opening but is only good for a day. Provides a servings of fluid, a serving of protein, and a serving of vegetables.

**Pill of Delution**, $150, .neg  
This can be dissolved into a beverage to reduce its overall points of inebriation by 1. A single pill per serving will not noticably affect the beverage otherwise. A second pill could potentially be detected. A third such application is most certain to be noticed.

**Powdered Water**, $180, .neg  
This powder is typically sold in one gram "doses", but can be used in any quantity. If a few drops of water are sprinkled onto (or into) the dose of powder, the powder slowly dissolves to produce more water. A single dose produces a serving of water in the course of two rounds. _Another round will cuase an additional serving of water to be produced_. If the container is not capable of holding all of the liquid, the excess will flow out as though the vessal had been over filled. If the container is sealed, the excess water will wait until there is space for it to occupy before it manifests. This is best stored in a cool dry environment. If transporting it, glass is recommended to prevent accidental moistening.  
If sea water is used, the water can still be consumed safely- but will have a bitter salty flavor. You will also feel nauseous for about 1d6+2 hours per serving.

**Thunderous Dragon Tube**, $760, 2 lb.  
A tube filled with explosive powder and metal pellets. It can be affixed to a polearm or used as part of a trap. The included fuse can be ignited as an action to cause it to detonate 1 second after (or at the end of the next phase of a round). Once detonated, it explodes outward in a 3 yard cone. Anything caught in it suffers a fire attack with disadvantage and a piercing attack.  
Caution advised in ensuring it is pointed in the correct direction.

#### POTIONS, ELIXIRS, TINCTURES, AND MORE
Potions come in terracotta vessels sealed with wax. This makes them fragile and easily disposable. They also have a shelf life of 1d6+6 weeks before the substance is ruined by the terracotta. Glass containers are also fragile, but reusable and provide no such degredation of the substance (granting it a lifespan in years not weeks). This costs an additional $40. Glass capable of being shipped on a cart speeding down the mountains may set you back even more, especially if it is crafted by an artisan.

**Curative Potion**, $800, .4 lb.  
This concoction requires 2 whole rounds to quaff. At the end of the round after it was finished, _the user recovers a random wound. Additionally, they are restored for any wounds received from toxic attacks since they began drinking the potion. A partially consumed potion only grants recovery of toxic wounds_, but could theoretically be served to two creatures this way by using a single round each. 
Once imbibed, you cannot benefit from another Curative Potion for 2d12 hours.

**Drisk’s Eye Opener**, $900, .4 lb.  
This concoction requires a whole round to quaff.  During the next round, _the imbiber may choose to perform an action during a movement phase or have an additional reaction_.

This concoction requires 3 whole rounds to finish. _It recovers your most recent wound immediately. For the next 6 hours, at the end of each hour, the imbiber may make a [Fort] check with a DV equal 20 + the number of current wounds to recover their most recent wound. Additionally, during this time, the imbiber gains a +1 bonus to all [Fort] saves and all forms of toxic attack against the imbiber have disadvantage_.

**Potion of Greatness**, $1,000, .5 lb.

If successful, the total fatigue you receive is reduced by 1 and the potion’s effect ends_.  

**Resistance Potion**, $400, .2 kg.  
A concoction which comes in a variety of equally awful flavors. These potions can be consumed in 3 whole rounds, though some may find 5 necessary to deal with the taste. The potion itself is designed with one of the below damage types. _For the next 1d3+3 hours, all attacks of the appropriate type against you have disadvantage. You suffer a -1 penalty to [Fort] checks and saves during this time and for an hour afterwards_.

**Liquid Bravery**, $320, neg.
