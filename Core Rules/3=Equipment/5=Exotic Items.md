### EXOTIC ITEMS
Here are some of the more magical items one may come across. 

**Boutava's Beneficial Bourbon**, $275 per bottle, 3 lbs.  
The bottle includes a paper adhered to its body, 
> "When the eldritch horrors get rough with your body, reach for the smooth taste that replenishes your soul. With 17 essential vitamins and minerals and a proprietary blend of fine spirits and botanicals, our cask strength panacea can be used by adventurers of any experience with complete confidence. While others may sell you oil d'naga blends with subpar liquors, we have taken oaths to 3 different gods of festivities to ensure our employees never falter in delivering to you the premium product you demand for your active lifestle. When you are close to joining the spirits, choose the spirits more professionals reach for."

A bottle contains 25 servings, which are each capable of giving a character 2 points of enebriation. A character gains no hydration from this and will infact require an additional serving of water for every 3 servings they partake in. Whether taken orally or topically, this can provide a 1d4 *(and an additional +1 as an effect of its latent magics)* bonus to a medicine check to the one it is administered. Additionally, *there is a % chance equal to the number of servings they take that they will recover a single hitpoint*.

**Candle of Charilluroxis**, $900, .25 lb.  
A candle made of the tallow of Charilluroxis- last of the legendary tyranical dragons to be slain. If lit, it provides fair loght for 1 foot and dimm light for 2 feet beyond that. It floats, but the tallow will begin smoking as it alowly dissolves. It dissolves at a rate of ½ ounce per round. Each round it dissolves, a choking smoke emit from it out 1 foot. Anything which breathes in the area of the amoke is subject to a [Fort] or [Will] save (their choice) with a DV of 14 or be prone twice as long as they are in the smoke. The candle can burn for 24 hours, with ½ ounce of the candle being burned up for every 3 hours it burns. Anything that eats tallow candles will find this a delicacy. Drakomadiae will find the smell of its burning rather repulsive.  
*The candle cannot be snffed out by magical means of any kind*.

**Coldon's Brassing Powder**, $390 per ounce,  
Mix this powder with a few drops of vinegar to produce a polish rivaled by nothing else for use on metal. It also can benefit armor to some extant. Armor thoroughly coated in this stuff will see a +1 to defense against magical forms of acid, cold, fire, and electric attacks *which is increased to a +2 for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit*. Clothen armors typically carry a stench once this is applied and leather will begin to grow what appears to be yellow mold (but isn't) which distorts the color and feel of the leather. To ensure a proper amount is applied to armor, one should use about 1 ounce per 10-15 pounds of armor. This will only lasts for 3-4 hours.  
After 24 hours from application, there is a % chance that the armor receives a point of damage equal to 10 + the number of times this has been applied to armor. Metal based armors see this reduced to half.

**Coldon's Powdered Ale**, $200 per serving, neg.  
_This powder can turn half a serving of water into a serving of ale by sprinkling it into the water and giving it the slightest stir_. We don't know how this works anymore than you, but we wish it wasn't so expensive. Roll a d20. The narrator secretly chooses a number. If the die result matches the number, the ale will taste awful. Otherwise, it is rather servicable.

**Dust of Disjunction**, $1,000, neg.  
Represents one “dose”. This powder is capable of temporarily rendering magic inert. An object or creature with a dose of this sprinkled over them has its magical features become negated while covered. Larger creatures/objects may require more doses, but a single dose can be sprinkled on a person or a 4" by 4" square. This lasts so long as the object is covered, but the dust itself usually becomes inert after it has been removed or itself rendered so by something else. The dust is water soluble and becomes inert when absorbed by any liquid, but a single dose will ruin a potion.
If this dust is mixed into another magical dust or powder, it will likely render it inert as well.  
Not recommended to handle without protection, but not harmful to the touch.

**Elfen Flask**, $7,000 , .25 lb plus contents  
A finely made flask which appears to be made of silver or deorium. These were made long ago by people now forgotten. It holds up to 2 servings of water. Any beverage kept in it, while it is sealed, *will now experience the effects of time including typical spoilage*. Furthermore, clean water which is held within for 5d20+100 years *will become elfen water*. When found on an adventure, they usually have 1d2 servings of elfen water. They are considered valuable and collectible artifacts which may see a sell value increase by as much as 30% in most markets (roll a d20 and a d10. Treat a 0 result of the d10 as a 10).

**Ernstine Bead**, $950 , neg.  
A glass bead of swirling amber and crimson. This item can cause a terrible explosion. When handled by a creature capable of casting spells, *it can be squeezed as an action. When doing so, a number of rounds between 1-10 is selected. After that many rounds, a d4 is rolled. After a number of phases have passed equal to the d4 result, it explodes in a roar of flame out 3 yards in all directions. Anything caught in the explosion is subject to a fire attack. The attack gets a bonus equal to the d4 result for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit*. If a creature handles the bead once it has been activated, it will explode (without the bonus for the purpose of critical hits).

**Glass Scabbard**, $350, 2 lb.  
A glass scabbard custom blown to fit a dagger. It can store a liquid inside to ensure the blade is thoroughly coated when drawn. This allows one to have a dose of a poison (or other concoction) applied to the dagger by simply storing it for a few rounds as they move. Filling it requires caution and it is recommended not to but anything in that could harm the blade. A similar such scabbard could be made for anything longer than a dagger, but an additional $125 for every foot of range is added to the price.  
These were once popular among nobles as a fashion, but have fallen out of favor.

**Paetur's Stew Jar**, $250 , 1.75 lb.  
An amber colored jar, sealed with grey-green wax. The contents look like broth with shreds of some disintegrating material. Opening the jar _instead reveals its true contents to be a hot and hardy stew with plenty of veggies, beef, and venison_. The stew is fresh upon opening but is only good for a day. Provides a servings of fluid, a serving of protein, and a serving of vegetables. If opened in a area wherein magic cannot function, you will instead be treated to the sort of contents you observed and it will make you sick.

**Phial of Fog**, $480, neg.  
A glass capsule which can be busted open by throwing it against any hard surface. Upon doing so, the very thin flowing liquid inside begins to vaporize. It produces an effect identical to the Fogflow spell except where noted here. The size of the fogcloud starts at 1 foot and the fog cloud lasts 1d4+6 rounds. It is not a magical effect. 

**Pill of Delution**, $150, neg.  
This can be dissolved into a beverage to reduce its overall points of inebriation by 1. A single pill per serving will not noticably affect the beverage otherwise. A second pill could potentially be detected. A third such application is most certain to be noticed.

**Powdered Water**, $180, neg.  
This powder is typically sold in one gram "doses", but can be used in any quantity. If a few drops of water are sprinkled onto (or into) the dose of powder, the powder slowly dissolves to produce more water. A single dose produces a serving of water in the course of two rounds. _Another round will cuase an additional serving of water to be produced_. If the container is not capable of holding all of the liquid, the excess will flow out as though the vessal had been over filled. If the container is sealed, the excess water will wait until there is space for it to occupy before it manifests. This is best stored in a cool dry environment. If transporting it, glass is recommended to prevent accidental moistening.  
If sea water is used, the water can still be consumed safely- but will have a bitter salty flavor. You will also feel nauseous for about 1d6+2 hours per serving.

**Rospuine Egg**, $300-350 , .25 to .5 lb.  
The egg of a rospunar. These translucent shells bear within a flame which seems to last for a year. If the shell is compromised, the inner flame flashes out in a rush. The shell itself is impervious to fire of any temperature. Water will dissolve the shell. The common use for this item is to instanly bring a pot of water to boil. Another common use is to place at the location you wish start a fire, and splash a bit of water on it.  

**Thunderous Dragon Tube**, $760, 2 lb.  
A tube filled with explosive powder and metal pellets. It can be affixed to a polearm or used as part of a trap. The included fuse can be ignited as an action to cause it to detonate 1 second after (or at the end of the next phase of a round). Once detonated, it explodes outward in a 3 yard cone. Anything caught in it suffers a fire attack with disadvantage and a piercing attack.  
Caution advised in ensuring it is pointed in the correct direction.

#### POTIONS, ELIXIRS, TINCTURES, AND MORE
Potions come in terracotta vessels sealed with wax. This makes them fragile and easily disposable. They also have a shelf life of 1d6+6 weeks before the substance is ruined by the terracotta. Glass containers are also fragile, but reusable and provide no such degredation of the substance (granting it a lifespan in years not weeks). This costs an additional $40. Glass capable of being shipped on a cart speeding down the mountains may set you back even more, especially if it is crafted by an artisan.

**Curative Potion**, $800, .4 lb.  
This concoction requires 2 whole rounds to quaff. At the end of the round after it was finished, _the user recovers a random wound. Additionally, they are restored for any wounds received from toxic attacks since they began drinking the potion. A partially consumed potion only grants recovery of toxic wounds_, but could theoretically be served to two creatures this way by using a single round each. 
Once imbibed, you cannot benefit from another Curative Potion for 2d12 hours.

**Drisk’s Eye Opener**, $900, .4 lb.  
This concoction requires a whole round to quaff.  During the next round, _the imbiber may choose to perform an action during a movement phase or have an additional reaction_.

**Elfen Water**, $25,000, .5 lb.  
Found only in containers that can magically preserve their contents for centuries. This water manages to always taste cool, crip, and rereshing- with  a hint of sweetness. *The water cannot be spoiled or manipulated by magical means*. AN imbiber of a single portion will find its quenches thirst just as water would, but also bestows 1d4+1 points of inebriation almost as though it were a liqeurous spirit though this will often affect first time consumers immediately as opposed to most forms of alcohol. Additionally, *there is a % chance equal to the received points of inebriation that they will recover a single hitpoint*. An elf does not receive more than a single point of inebriation, but still has a *5% chance of recovering a hitpoint*.

**Elixir of Invulnerability**, $2,750, .7 lb.  
A concoction which requires an entire minute to consume properly. *For the next 1d6+4 hours, you gain a +1 bonus to defense against all attacks. +2 if unarmored.

Furthermore, the imbiber gains a bonus to defense against non-magical attacks equal to half the number of hours remaining in the effect’s duration*.

**Mnemonic Aid**, $600, .4 lb.

    • _You gain a +1 to all [Fort] saves_.  
    • _You gain an additional +1 to all saves and checks_.

**Potion of Stamina**, $160, .4 lb.  
After imbibing this as an action, _you gain a +1 bonus to your next [Body] save made within 1d8+2 minutes. If you would take on a level of fatigue for any reason other than performing a speacial feature or a magical effect during this time, you perform a [Fort] save with DV of 22. If successful, the total fatigue you receive is reduced by 1 and the potion’s effect ends_.
