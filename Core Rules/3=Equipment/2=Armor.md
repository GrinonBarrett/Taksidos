## ARMOR
So- you got some neat features from your character's species, some shiny abilities from your selected character class, got the basics for life on the go, and now you feel primed and ready. As convenient as it would be to simply run and gun, at the end of the day, your character is flesh and bone and needs to keep those bits together. A bit of armor goes a long way to ensure you keep having fun with that brand new character of yours.

Armor, for the sake of this game is divided into 6 classifications:  
-**U**narmored. Not technically armor, but some magical garments which can be worn are treated as though you were unarmored. This represents a person without proper protection.  
-**G**ambeson. Padded, cloth, quilten, and/or leather based armors typically fall into this category. These are usually used by the poorest on the battlefield or by light cavalry.  
-**B**rigandine. A primarily cloth form of protection reinforced with economical metal plates. This can include historical brigandine, chihal'ta hazar masha, or kikko.  
-**M**aile. Armor composed of links, scale, or small plates. This includes classic chainmail, mirror armor, and lamallar.  
-**C**uirass. This represents partial forms of plate armor, proper cuirass, and similar segmented armors of rigid material- like the lorica.  
-**P**late. A full suit of plate armor or other wholly protective designs. It is not uncommon to incorporate portions of mail and/or gambeson in its form.


#### Damage to Armor
Anytime an attack result is the exact result required to strike the wearer, the exact result required to inflict a critical hit, or within a single point of such, it will damage the armor. When the armor has been damaged a certain number of times (dictated by the armor itself), it is impaired. Damage can be repaired.

##### Impaired Armor
Impaired armor is damaged in such a manner as to cause lessor harm and great discomfort to the wearer. One donning impaired armor has a -1 penalty to attack rolls, skill checks, and saves. Once the armor has become impaired, it may only receive so much more damage before it is also rendered useless.

##### Useless Armor
When wearing armor which is useless, an attacker may choose whether to treat you as being unarmored or gain a +2 bonus to their attack against you. Armor rendered useless cannot be repaired and can be sold as scrap for 10% of its value to an armorer if you are lucky.
