#### MOUNT GEAR AND FEED

**Animal Feed**		$1 per lb.  
Common dry food for livestock. A single pound provides two servings of food for mounts unless otherwise noted. 

**Barding, Horse** $8,000 25 lb.  
Armor to protect the head and front of a horse. Includes some blanketing, plates, and (somewhat inferior) mail. Protection for horses is rather minimal as they are already burdened by the weight of the rider and their facing profile is narrow. It does not protect the rear.

**Tack and Saddle, Draftsnail** $2,500  26 lb.  
This includes all wear required to work with, or even ride, a draftsnail. Since draftsnails are very rarely ridden or used outside of the Lazine empire, this can be difficult to find.

**Tack and Saddle, Horse**  $2,400 25 lb.  
This includes a saddle and all wear required to ride or work with the horse.
