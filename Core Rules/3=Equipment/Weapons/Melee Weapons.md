**Table**: *Melee Weapon Attack versus Armor*
| Weapon                 | Cost | Weight      | Range | Special Features| Notes |
|------------------------|------|-----------|----------|---------------|------------|
|                        |      |           |          |            |  |
| Club                | $40 | 3 lb | 2 feet   | - | A glorified stick or baton. Nothing complex about this classic design. Only slightly better than an improvised weapon. |
| Dagger                 | $60 | 1 lb | 1 foot   | - | A simple dagger as can be used by almost anyone.  |
| Flail              | $220 | 4.25 lb | 1 yard   | Must be wound as an action or in place of movement during the round to attack. If wound twice in a round, the attack gains a +1 bonus. This weapon grants a +2 bonus to Beat and Parry checks, but Beat and Parry checks gain a +2 bonus against attacks made with it. The type of head determines the attack type, but does not otherwise affect the weapon's properties. A standard head is treated as a mace attack. A spiked head is treated as a morningstar. You do not use the weapon training of those weapons when using a flail and instead resort to your training with the flail. | An uncommon weapon which is also called the Footman's Flail. A few skilled indivduals can utilize the unique traits of this weapon. A yard long handle with a chain connecting the head of the weapon. The head comes in a varity of flavors. |
| Greatsword             | $245 | 6.5 lb | 3 yards   | Requires two hands. | A very long blade which is not operated like most swords. This weapon relies on pivoting more so than others- creating an arc of danger almost 10 feet out from the wielder. A common form of this sword are often known as claymores, but some different regions may have their own names for them. |
| Hand Axe               | $150 | 3 lb | 1 yard   | - | A common axe intended for use as a secondary weapon. It is not uncommon to see in the arsenal when adventuring due to the other practical functions of an axe. |
| Katar                  | $120 | 2 lb | 1 foot*   | Range is increased by the range of your unarmed attack. If you successfully parry an unarmed attack, dagger weapon attack, or katar weapon attack, you may perform an attack of opporunity against them. Alternatively, if you successfully parry an attack, you may sidestep. The reach of this weapon is 1 foot beyond the range of your unarmed attack. | The classic punching knife. |
| Longsword              | $160 | 3.5 lb | 1 yard | - | The proper term is "Arming Sword", but most players will recognise longsword more easily. Represents most swords which can be used with one or two hands. |
| Mace                   | $180 | 4 lb | 1 yard   | - | A weighted head, occasionally armed with flanges, attached to a secure handle. A choice weapon for dispatching brittle monsters and any foolish enough not to provide plenty of padding to their armor. |
| Madu               | $200 | 3.5 lb | 1 yard   | Can be used to block in the same manner as a shield if an attack was not made with it during the same phase. If used in the main hand, it grants a +2 bonus. If used in an off hand, it provides only a +1 bonus. | An exotic weapon which better suits a defenisve fighting style. |
| Maul                   | $160 | 4.5 lb | 1.5 yards   | Requires two hands. | A large wooden block on attached to handle. This is the knight's secret weapon against other knights. The blockhead is encased by steel strips to help prevent splinttering due to damage. |
| Morningstar            | $180 | 4 lb | 1 yard   | - | The punk-rock cousin of the mace, the morningstar's orb of a head is adorned with spikes to really get the point across. |
| Pike                   | $210 | 9 lb | 4 yards   | Requires two hands. You can potentially attack over someone between yourself and the foe, but this imposes a -1 on the attack for each intervening creature. Attacks made against a foe within three-quarters range (3 yards) have disadvantage. | A timeless weapon. |
| Pole Axe               | $220 | 5 lb | 2 yards   | Requires two hands. | A large axe intended for use with both hands. The shaft is shorter than most polearms while the blade is longer and in greater embrace of the shaft. |
| Spear                  | $180 | 5.5 lb | 3 yards   | Requires two hands. You can potentially attack over someone between yourself and the foe, but this imposes a -1 on the attack for each intervening creature. Attacks made against a foe within half range (1.5 yards) have disadvantage. | The common spear to be found on the battlefield. |
| Warpick                | $190 | 4 lb | 1 yard   | - | A widely misunderstood weapon. It is intended to be used against a foe once they have been cast off balance, such as when they have been laid out. |
|                        |      |           |          |            |  |
