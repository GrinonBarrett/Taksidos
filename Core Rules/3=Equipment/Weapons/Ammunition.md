### AMMUNITION
Most ranged weapons require ammunition. Ammunition does not do well as an improvised weapon if at all.

**Arrow** (Bodkin Point, per 10 arrows), $40, 1 lb.  
A common type of arrow.

**Arrow** (Broadhead, per 10 arrows), $40, 1 lb.  
Preferred for hunting over a bodkin point.

**Bolt** (Bodkin Point, per 10 bolts), $40, 1 lb.  
The standard bolt used by most crossbowmen.

**Arquebus Bullet** (per 6 shots), $47, .25 lb.  
A thin wrapper of paper or cloth with enough powder to propel the bullet when fired. It becomes useless when wet.

**Musket Bullet** (per 4 shots), $50, .2 lb.  
Larger than an arquebus bullet, they are not compatible with each other.

**Tronutonante Bullet** (per 10 shots), $64, .3 lb.  
Can be fired through an arquebus or musket, but ranges are halved and a -4 penalty is applied.

### MAGICAL AMMUNITION
Given the scarity of magic items, let alone magic weapons, and how little it takes to make ammunition rather than a whole weapon, magic ammunition is more common than magic ranged weapons.

**Arrow of Noxious End**, $1,800, neg.  
It appears as a common type of broadhead arrow.  
_After a number of rounds equal to the attack roll- the subject will have to make [Fort] save with a DV of 18 or receive a wound as a result of the toxic damage. At the end of the next round, and at the end of a number of rounds following that equal to half of the attack roll’s points of success, the struck creature must succeed a [Fort] save of 15 or suffer a toxic attack. A critical success reduces the duration of this by a number of rounds equal to the points of success. Additionally, a creature is sickened for a number of hours equal to half of the attack roll's total points of success. Any rest received druing this time is treated as half._

**Arrow of Slaying**, $5,000, neg.  
A bodkin point arrow which appears to be barbed or gnarled. If this arrow strikes a humanoid, it inflicts an additional wound. _This arrow gets a +1 to attack rolls against humanoids. When a humanoid is struck by this arrow, it inflicts a wound- even if the attack was unsuccessful. Then the creature must succeed a [Fort] or [Will] save with a DV equal to the attack's points of success or die immediately. If the creature survived, it must succeed a [Will] save with the same DV or be frightened by its proximity to death for a number of rounds equal to double the points of failure. This fright causes the creature to be dazed and suffer a -1 penalty to all saves_. The arrow will be stuck in the struck creature, causing a -1 penalty to all checks and saves. It can be removed with a successful [Body] check result of 10 or greater, which has disadvantage if the struck creature is being hostile or still frightened by the arrow's magic. Once the arrow has struck any creature, its magic is lost.

**Arrow of the Faire-feller**, $750, neg.  
An iron broadhead adorns the alder shaft of this arrow. An item struck by the arrow loses any magical properties for 1d20 minutes. A creature struck by the arrow by 2d10 rounds. Once the arrow has affected a creature or magic item, the arrow is nothing more than a normal arrow.

**Baneful Arrow**, $3,600, neg.  
A masterfully crafted broadhead arrow. A baneful arrow is made with a specific creature type to be associated with it. Attacks against that creature type have advantage. _The arrow will deal an additional wound to such a creature on a critical hit. Additionally, there is a 5% chance for the creature to be dealt two additional wounds if the attack was successful_. Once this arrow has been used to strike such a creature, the magic is lost.

**Flashine Bullet**, +$200 each, neg.  
An amber colored hard substance is used for the ball in this round. This can be purchased for any firearm- with the cost being added to that of the bullet. The ammunition does not technically have a magical effect, but is a product of alchemy and is often treated as such by merchants and vendors.  
Upon impact, a bright flash lights up the area. Anything within 15 yards must succeed a [Rflx] or [Prcp] save with a DV of 15 or be blinded for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. A creature within 5 yards has disadvantage on its save. A creature beyond 10 yards has advantage on this save.  
Cover bonuses to defense can be applied to the save at the narrator’s discretion.  

**Thunder Bolt**, $950, neg.  
It appears as a common type of bolt.  
_Upon impact, an explosion of thunder emits forth- causing anything within 15 yards to make a [Prcp] save with a DV of 15 or become deafened for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure +1d20. A struck creature has disadvantage on this save.  
A critical hit is treated as a sonic attack. Additionally, an a critical hit, a bolt of lightning strikes the foe from a nearby cloud (or the crossbow if no such cloud is available), treat as an electrical attack_.
