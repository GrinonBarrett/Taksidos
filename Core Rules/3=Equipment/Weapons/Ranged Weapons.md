Special Notes

**Diskus**, $160  
Brusgiata  
A thicker, heavier brusgiata which is traditionally used for sport throwing. A proper technique spinning the entirety of your body can improve the overall power of this weapon.
Weight is increased to 3.5 lb and range is reduced by 1/3. In place of a normal movement, you may move 1 yard closer to your target which is at least 10 yards away. If you do, roll a d20 and compare it to your [Body] or [Rflx], your choice. If the result is lower than the attribute, an attack with the weapon you make against that foe during the next phase ignores the penalty to range and gains a +1 to its result. Regardless of the result, you are prone during the two phases.

**Trunotor**, $400  
Arquebus  
An arquebus designed for smaller creatures. It can also be used by a younger member of the medium szied species. It fires a trunotonante bullet, has a total range of 180 Yards, and and optimal range of 3-90 yards. The weight is down to 7 pounds. Can be used with a [Body] of 10 or greater without ill effect. If used with a lower [Body] score, each point of difference brings with it a point of recoil. Treat as a trunotonante attack.

**Lanciator**, $485  
Musket  
A musket designed for smaller creatures. It fires an arquebus bullet, has a total range of 200 Yards, and and optimal range of 3-100 yards. The weight is down to 9 pounds. Treat as an arquebus attack.
