Special Notes

**Diskus**, $160  
Brusgiata  
A thicker, heavier brusgiata which is traditionally used for sport throwing. A proper technique spinning the entirety of your body can improve the overall power of this weapon.
Weight is increased to 3.5 lb and range is reduced by 1/3. In place of a normal movement, you may move 1 yard closer to your target which is at least 10 yards away. If you do, roll a d20 and compare it to your [Body] or [Rflx], your choice. If the result is lower than the attribute, an attack with the weapon you make against that foe during the next phase ignores the penalty to range and gains a +1 to its result. Regardless of the result, you are prone during the two phases.

**Trunotor**, $400  
Arquebus  
An arquebus designed for smaller creatures. It can also be used by a younger member of the medium szied species. It fires a trunotonante bullet, has a total range of 180 Yards, and and optimal range of 3-90 yards. The weight is down to 7 pounds. Can be used with a [Body] of 10 or greater without ill effect. If used with a lower [Body] score, each point of difference brings with it a point of recoil. Treat as a trunotonante attack.

**Lanciator**, $485  
Musket  
A musket designed for smaller creatures. It fires an arquebus bullet, has a total range of 200 Yards, and and optimal range of 3-100 yards. The weight is down to 9 pounds. Treat as an arquebus attack.

**Mechanical Crossbow**, $400, 10 lb  
Crossbow  
An invention of Lancelittle Machinehand, predating the introduction of firearms in the west by a mere year, these weapons can be a bit fiddly. Requires [Body] 10+ to reload and the use of standard mechanical tools. Reloading requires 2 consecutive actions. You may forego your movement during a movement phase to contribute an additional action towards this. Gains a +1 for the purpose of determining a critical hit. Attacks within optimal range also gain a +1 bonus.  
Can also be used to fire sling bullets, inflicting a sling attack and using the ranges for a shortbow.  
Anytime the weapon is cranked and fired, there is a 1 in 20 chance the mechanism will fail- rendring it useless (let the player choose a number when making their attack roll).

**Repeating Crossbow**, $200  
Crossbow  
A home defense weapon. This crossbow fires two proprietary bolt when attacking, inflicting a single thrown blade attack against a foe. The maximum range is only 120 yards with an optimal range of between 2 and 50 yards.If it is somehow fired with only one bolt, it suffers a -2 to its attack. Anytime the user performs an attack action with this weapon, if they have an additional limb available, they may perform two attacks. Each of these attacks consume ammunition. They may be against the same or different foes so long as they are in the same facing from the user.  
Cannot damage armor.  
Uses repeating bolts as the ammunition.

Repeating Bolt (per 20 bolts), $30, .7 lb.  
Used for repeating crossbows. Each can be set to hold a dose of venom or poison which it can inflict against a foe on a critical hit or when the attack would qualify for damaging armor (even though it does not damage armor). If foe is unarmored, it can auomatically apply such a toxin upon a successful wound.

**Vihanesulg**, $300, 9.5 lb  
Crossbow  
Requires [Body] 14+ to reload. Reloading requires 3 consecutive actions. You may forego your movement during a movement phase to contribute an additional action towards this.

Designed to be used with a "Goat's foot", a metal fork costing about $8 which can either allow the user to reload with 1 action fewer or to reload with a [Body] of only 12 or 13.
