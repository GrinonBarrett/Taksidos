Most weapons are assumed to be of wood, iron, and/or steel. Some weapons can be made of other materials. This can confer some changes to it.

**Altyprium**  
A bronze weapon weighs about 5% more if the weapon is primarily metal. It has a chance of breaking upon a hard impact. If the attack is a critical failure, the weapon shatters. Additionally, if the attack is made against a hard surfaced or a foe weaing armor other than gambeson, and the attack roll is exactly 1 point below what is required for success or critical success, the weapon shatters.  
Such a weapon costs 15% less.

**Bronze**  
A bronze weapon weighs about 10% more if the weapon is primarily metal. It has a chance of breaking upon a hard impact. If the attack is a critical failure, the weapon shatters. Addittionally, if the attack is made against a hard surfaced or a foe weaing armor other than gambeson, and the attack roll is exactly 1 point below what is required for success, the weapon shatters.  
While ancient weapons used to be cheaper when made of bronze, such a weapon now can run you 3 or 4 times the usual bill.
