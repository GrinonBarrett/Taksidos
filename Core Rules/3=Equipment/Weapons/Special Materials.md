Most weapons are assumed to be of wood, iron, and/or steel. Some weapons can be made of other materials. This can confer some changes to it.

**Altyprium**  
An altyprium weapon weighs about 5% more if the weapon is primarily metal. It has a chance of breaking upon a hard impact. If the attack is a critical failure, the weapon shatters. Additionally, if the attack is made against a hard surfaced or a foe weaing armor other than gambeson, and the attack roll is exactly 1 point below what is required for success or critical success, the weapon shatters.  
Such a weapon costs 15% less.

**Bronze**  
A bronze weapon weighs about 10% more if the weapon is primarily metal. It has a chance of breaking upon a hard impact. If the attack is a critical failure, the weapon shatters. Addittionally, if the attack is made against a hard surfaced or a foe weaing armor other than gambeson, and the attack roll is exactly 1 point below what is required for success, the weapon shatters.  
While ancient weapons used to be cheaper when made of bronze, such a weapon now can run you 3 or 4 times the usual bill.

**Bone/Merrian**  
A weapon composed of bone and other elements found underwater. These are made in the fashion of the merfolk and prove quite useful. For sharp edges, it is recommended theybe well whet and oiled to maintain performance. They typically weigh 10% less than normal weapons- but this is ignored for weapons composed mostly of wood (such as mauls, spears, piles, and other polearm).  
Regardless, they cost 25% more than normal weapon and are very rare to find above the ocean.  
Cannot be used to make bows.
