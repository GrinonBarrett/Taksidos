## SCATTERGUNS
Scatterguns function differently than most personal eapns and come in two flavors, at least for the handheld variety. These are the Blunderbuss, a weapon intended for self defense primarily, and the much larger Trommor.

###### While these weapons are included in the basic rules, it is reasonable for a narrator to wish to ignore them as they can complicate combat to an extant.

#### Blunderbuss
Costs $550, weighs 12.5 pounds.  
Requires two hands to fire.  
Loaded like an arquebus, despite using 
Upon firing a blunder buss, determine how many creatures and pieces of cover for said creatures occupy a 12 yard mikrofan. The blunderbuss inflicts 1d3+3 trunotonante attacks divided by the number of such targets in the are to each creature. If there is a fraction after dividing the total number of attacks, or all attacks would affect a single target, round down and give the attack(s) against the closest target advantage. A creature in front of another creature, impeding the path of the mikrofan, is treated as cover for the following statement. The mikrofan's area of effect is stopped by cover. Attacks made at a range greater than 10 yards have disadvantage. Can fire an arquebus bullet as though it were an arquebus, but uses the ranges of a trunotonante.

#### Trommor
Costs $780, weighs 15 pounds.  
A much larger version of the blunderbuss, it uses a small paper and pine canister which is rammed into the breech as its ammunition. Because of the design of their cartridges, these weapons are less subject to fouling than something like a musket if it remains unshot. It functions the same wy with they following exceptions.  
* Area is increased to a 15 yard mikrofan.
* The number of attacks are increased to 1d4+6.
* It cannot fire an arquebus bullet.
* THe cannister used for ammunition often includes an additional effect.
* If an attack roll result is exactly a 9, the weapon becomes unuasable as the canister mucks up the barrel due to improper ignition.

Blunderbuss Shot (per), $9.5, .25 lb.  
Not too dissimilar from the same paper cartridge of most firearms, though it contains multiple smaller bullets within the shot.

Standard Tromoor Cannister (per shot), $156, .6 lb.  
A paper drum shaped cartidge with boning of pine. It is burnt almost completely in the process of firing. It contains various sized pieces of muniton inside. Anything successfully wounded by the trommor is also subject to a sling attack.
