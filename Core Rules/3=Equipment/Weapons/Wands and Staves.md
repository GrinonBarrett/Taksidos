### Wands
Each wand uses a particular attribute and produces a specific type of attack. To be able to operate a wand, you must have that attribute as a 13 or greater. When using a wand, if your attack die roll result is an odd number, you suffer a point of spell sickness. The attack of a wand is a magical effect, regardless of how it is used. The narrator can easily create wands of their own imagination. All attacks from wands are considered to be rays.
