All weapons presented are intended for medium size creatures.

When using a weapon intended for a size category other than your own, you suffer a penalty to your attack, beat, and parry checks equal to the difference squared.  
E.g -1 if one size category different, -4 if two, -9 if three, etc.

Additionally, if the weapon is for a larger size, you must have an additional half again as much [Body] to use it per difference in category.  
E.g if a large weapon would normally require 8 [Body] to use in two hands and 12 to use in one hand, it would instead require 12 to use in two hands and 18 to use in one for a medium creature.  
If a small creature were to wield it, it would need 16 [Body] to use in two hands and 24 to use in one hand!
