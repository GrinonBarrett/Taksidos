Create characters to test combat. Each character will have a level 0, 1, 5, and 8 variant to compare.
* Grisam, An axe and board user. Capable with a bow. Prefers maile armor.

Redo Wounds per Round math, as the Oddu dagger only takes a single dagger attack into account and not 6.

Low level melee weapons test went well.

Still need to test longer reaching melee weapons, ranged weapons, and combat spells. Lethalility of combat spells is not looking to really compete with weapons and so the tiers and/or casting times could be reduced.
