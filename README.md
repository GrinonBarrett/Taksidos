End folders represent chapters, with each section being numbered in the recommended order of reading. The "Basics" document included should be read before anything else. Any file beginning with "0=" is the primer for that chapter and is highly recommended to be read before the other chapters.

###### May still include "simple" checks. Checks which do not benefit from critical success and do not require rolls by proficient characters.
