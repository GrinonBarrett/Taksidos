**Unusual Frame**: Aghglegulou can use most equipment just fine, but armor must be made especially for him. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for an oddu cost double what it would typically, and weighs half as much.

**Eight Tentacles**: You have eight tentacles which you can use as arms. All of them are off hands. You cannot gain any benefit from using more hands than a manfolk would (for example being able to use more than two hands on a sword) unless otherwise noted. This can allow you to wield up to four two-handed weapons. You only have the coordination to use as many tenactles as your current [Rflx] score. Certain tasks which might require fine manipulation, such as trying to pick a lock, are done with disadvantage.

If that creature was unaware of you, it becomes a 1d4 bonus instead. If it is vulnerable, any bonus you gain from this feature is doubled.

#### Tactical Step
Once per round, you may move 1 yard on land. This does not count as an action and does not count against your movement.

**Skills**: He is competent in Athletics, Survival, and Wrestling skills.

**Marine Breathing**:  He is equally capable of breathing normal air and breathing in untainted bodies of water.

**Unusual Frame**: Aghglegulou can use most equipment just fine, but armor must be made especially for him. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for an oddu cost double what it would typically, and weighs half as much.

**Eight Tentacles**: You have eight tentacles which you can use as arms. All of them are off hands. You cannot gain any benefit from using more hands than a manfolk would (for example being able to use more than two hands on a sword) unless otherwise noted. This can allow you to wield up to four two-handed weapons. You only have the coordination to use as many tenactles as your current [Rflx] score. Certain tasks which might require fine manipulation, such as trying to pick a lock, are done with disadvantage.

**Flex**: You gain a +1 bonus to Athletics and Wrestling checks/saves for each free "hand" you have.

**Octostride**: Your Run and Climb speeds are increased by half a foot for each free tentacle you have beyond 2.

#### Sneak Attack
When you perform an attack against a foe within 15 yards, if it is concentrating on a spell or otherwise distracted in such a way as to not focus on you (like when it is brawling), you gain a +1 bonus to that attack. If that creature was unaware of you, it becomes a 1d4 bonus instead. If it is vulnerable, any bonus you gain from this feature is doubled.

#### Tactical Step
Once per round, you may move 1 yard on land. This does not count as an action and does not count against your movement.

#### False Swipe
Once per round, when you perform a Feint, if a creature within 2 yards performs a reaction in response to it, it does not count against your reaction for the round.  
Additionally, when you perform a Feint against a creature, if it has fewer HP than your level, you know how many hitpoints it currently has.

#### Tumble
You may grant yourself an advantage to a [Rflx] save or an Athletics check which uses your [Rflx]. You must complete a rest before doing so again.

**Eight Tentacles**: You have eight tentacles which you can use as arms. All of them are off hands. You cannot gain any benefit from using more hands than a manfolk would (for example being able to use more than two hands on a sword) unless otherwise noted. This can allow you to wield up to four two-handed weapons. You only have the coordination to use as many tenactles as your current [Rflx] score. Certain tasks which might require fine manipulation, such as trying to pick a lock, are done with disadvantage.

**Flex**: You gain a +1 bonus to Athletics and Wrestling checks/saves for each free "hand" you have.

#### Tactical Step
Once per round, you may move 1 yard on land. This does not count as an action and does not count against your movement.

#### False Swipe
Once per round, when you perform a Feint, if a creature within 2 yards performs a reaction in response to it, it does not count against your reaction for the round.  
Additionally, when you perform a Feint against a creature, if it has fewer HP than your level, you know how many hitpoints it currently has.

#### Tumble
You may grant yourself an advantage to a [Rflx] save or an Athletics check which uses your [Rflx]. You must complete a rest before doing so again.

#### Fell Hand
If you successfully perform a sneak attack against a foe, roll a d12 and add your heroism. For a number of rounds equal to the result, anytime a creature makes an attack against that foe- they may modify the wound result by 2 steps.

#### Pinpoint Strike
When you perform an attack, before rolling the attack, you may use your reaction to grant yourself up to a -4 penalty to the attack. For each point of penalty, if the attack is successful, you gain a +3 bonus for the purposes of determining if it is a critcal hit and may modify the rolled wound by one step. If you were not detected by the foe, you may roll your sneak attack die and add that as an additional bonus for the purposes if determining if it is a critical hit.

---------------------

**Skills**: He is competent in Athletics, Survival, and Wrestling skills.

**Marine Breathing**:  He is equally capable of breathing normal air and breathing in untainted bodies of water.

**Unusual Frame**: Aghglegulou can use most equipment just fine, but armor must be made especially for him. Any variant of armor which is to be fit for an oddu cost double what it would typically, and weighs half as much.

**Eight Tentacles**: You have eight tentacles which you can use as arms. All of them are off hands. You cannot gain any benefit from using more hands than a manfolk would (for example being able to use more than two hands on a sword) unless otherwise noted. This can allow you to wield up to four two-handed weapons. You only have the coordination to use as many tenactles as your current [Rflx] score. Certain tasks which might require fine manipulation, such as trying to pick a lock, are done with disadvantage.

**Flex**: You gain a +1 bonus to Athletics and Wrestling checks/saves for each free "hand" you have.

**Octostride**: Your Run and Climb speeds are increased by half a foot for each free tentacle you have beyond 2.

#### Sneak Attack
When you perform an attack against a foe within 15 yards, if it is concentrating on a spell or otherwise distracted in such a way as to not focus on you (like when it is brawling), you gain a +1 bonus to that attack. If that creature was unaware of you, it becomes a 1d4 bonus instead. If it is vulnerable, any bonus you gain from this feature is doubled.

#### Tactical Step
Once per round, you may move 1 yard on land. This does not count as an action and does not count against your movement.

#### False Swipe
Once per round, when you perform a Feint, if a creature within 2 yards performs a reaction in response to it, it does not count against your reaction for the round.  
Additionally, when you perform a Feint against a creature, if it has fewer HP than your level, you know how many hitpoints it currently has.

#### Tumble
You may grant yourself an advantage to a [Rflx] save or an Athletics check which uses your [Rflx]. You must complete a rest before doing so again.

#### Fell Hand
If you successfully perform a sneak attack against a foe, roll a d12 and add your heroism. For a number of rounds equal to the result, anytime a creature makes an attack against that foe- they may modify the wound result by 2 steps.

#### Pinpoint Strike
When you perform an attack, before rolling the attack, you may use your reaction to grant yourself up to a -4 penalty to the attack. For each point of penalty, if the attack is successful, you gain a +3 bonus for the purposes of determining if it is a critcal hit and may modify the rolled wound by one step. If you were not detected by the foe, you may roll your sneak attack die and add that as an additional bonus for the purposes if determining if it is a critical hit.

#### Culling Blow
When you attack a creature afflicted by a Fell Hand, you may choose to modify the wound result by an additional 2 steps.

#### Relentless Striker
If a foe would dodge your attack, you may use your reaction to ignore the effects of that dodge. If you do, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack if your [Body] or [Rflx] is greater than the foe's and the attack would not be considered a sneak attack.

#### Riposte
Once per round, if you parry an attack and that attack would have been a critical failure, you may perform a melee attack against that foe.  
Additionally, each level of training in your weapon grants you a +1 to your Parry attempts.

#### Reaper's Answer
When you attack a creature you may use your reaction to push it towards death. If it has 0 hitpoints remaining, the DV of its incapacitation save is increased by the points of your attack's success. You must complete a long rest before doing so again.

| Katar                  | When you stand to a charge, you may choose to either perform an additional attack with your offhand or instead not have disadvantage on the [Rflx] check.|
| Throwing Blade         | In place of moving, you may perform an attack. |
