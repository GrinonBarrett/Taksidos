---------------------

**Skills**: He is competent in Athletics, Carousing, Merchantry, Riding and Roping skills.

**Advantaged**: Midan has the Student of War edge, which grants him his proficiency in greatsword.

**Versatility**: When you perform a skill check with a skill you are not proficient with, if you do not have advantage or disadvantage, you may choose to grant yourself advantage on that roll. You must complete a full rest before doing so again.

#### Basic Training
Every Warrior receives some training over their lifetime.  
When you inflict a critical hit with an attack, you know how many hitpoints that creature currently has remaining.

#### Pacing
At the beginning of any encounter, you may choose one of the following:

* **Haste**. You gain a +1 to attacks against foes with a later turn order than yourself.
* **Patience**. You gain a +1 to defense against foes with an earlier turn order than yourself.
* **Caution**. Choose a reaction, you are automatically braced for it during the first round of combat.

#### Shield Proficiency
Warriors are able to utilize their shield to a greater extent than others. You may use it as a weapon, treating it as a club. You do not benefit from the warrior's weapon mastery of the club when used this way. You can instead gain training with them as though they were a weapon class of their own (shields).

---------------------

**Skills**: He is competent in Athletics, Carousing, Merchantry, Riding and Roping skills.

**Advantaged**: Midan has the Student of War edge, which grants him his proficiency in greatsword.

**Versatility**: When you perform a skill check with a skill you are not proficient with, if you do not have advantage or disadvantage, you may choose to grant yourself advantage on that roll. You must complete a full rest before doing so again.

#### Basic Training
Every Warrior receives some training over their lifetime.  
When you inflict a critical hit with an attack, you know how many hitpoints that creature currently has remaining.

#### Pacing
At the beginning of any encounter, you may choose one of the following:

* **Haste**. You gain a +1 to attacks against foes with a later turn order than yourself.
* **Patience**. You gain a +1 to defense against foes with an earlier turn order than yourself.
* **Caution**. Choose a reaction, you are automatically braced for it during the first round of combat.

#### Shield Proficiency
Warriors are able to utilize their shield to a greater extent than others. You may use it as a weapon, treating it as a club. You do not benefit from the warrior's weapon mastery of the club when used this way. You can instead gain training with them as though they were a weapon class of their own (shields).

#### Tactical Step
Once per round, you may move 1 yard using your primary mode of movement. This does not count as an action and does not count against your movement.

#### Weight Bearer
Your load limits are increased by a number of pounds equal to your level.

#### Bravery
Anytime you make a save against a fear effect, you may roll a d6 and add the result to your total.

#### Focus Strike
When you successfully attack a foe, you may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to the attack equal to your heroism for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.

#### Aggressive Way
If you Press Attack to the first attack you make in the round, it does not count against your reaction for the round.

#### Riposte
Once per round, if you parry an attack and that attack would have been a critical failure, you may perform a melee attack against that foe.  
Additionally, each level of training in your weapon grants you a +1 to your Parry attempts.

#### Skilled Defense
If you are attacked with a weapon or unarmed attack and have a greater total level of training than the attacker, you may use your reaction to prevent them from gaining any benefits of their training. If you have the same level of training, you may choose to prevent them from gaining one specific benefit from their training.

#### Warrior Mastery
Midan has trained well with his weapons, giving him the equivalence of an additional level of training in the handaxe. He gains the benefit listed below.

##### **Table**: *Warrior Mastery*
| Weapon                 | Benefit      |
|------------------------|-----------|
|                        |           |
| Greatsword             | When you cleave with this weapon, you do not have disadvantage on attacks made within less than half of the weapon's range and may choose to extend the arc to 270 degress (your front and both sides). If you do, you may choose to either suffer a level of fatigue, become prone until the end of the next round, or become vulnerable until the end of the next round. |
| Pike                   | When you stand to a charge against a foe, its remaining movement (in feet) is divided by the points of success of your attack. Any result below 1 results in it being stopped. If the result is below .5, you may push it back a number of feet equal to your points of success divided by their lost movement (in feet). |
| Pole Axe               | You may choose to incur a penalty to your attack up to -4. If you do, for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit, the attack is treated as having a +2 for each point of penalty incurred this way so long as the attack hits. |

---------------------

**Skills**: He is competent in Athletics, Carousing, Merchantry, Riding and Roping skills.

**Advantaged**: Midan has the Student of War edge, which grants him his proficiency in greatsword.

**Versatility**: When you perform a skill check with a skill you are not proficient with, if you do not have advantage or disadvantage, you may choose to grant yourself advantage on that roll. You must complete a full rest before doing so again.

#### Basic Training
Every Warrior receives some training over their lifetime.  
When you inflict a critical hit with an attack, you know how many hitpoints that creature currently has remaining.

#### Pacing
At the beginning of any encounter, you may choose one of the following:

* **Haste**. You gain a +1 to attacks against foes with a later turn order than yourself.
* **Patience**. You gain a +1 to defense against foes with an earlier turn order than yourself.
* **Caution**. Choose a reaction, you are automatically braced for it during the first round of combat.

#### Shield Proficiency
Warriors are able to utilize their shield to a greater extent than others. You may use it as a weapon, treating it as a club. You do not benefit from the warrior's weapon mastery of the club when used this way. You can instead gain training with them as though they were a weapon class of their own (shields).

#### Tactical Step
Once per round, you may move 1 yard using your primary mode of movement. This does not count as an action and does not count against your movement.

#### Weight Bearer
Your load limits are increased by a number of pounds equal to your level.

#### Bravery
Anytime you make a save against a fear effect, you may roll a d6 and add the result to your total.

#### Focus Strike
When you successfully attack a foe, you may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to the attack equal to your heroism for the purpose of determining if it is a critical hit.

#### Aggressive Way
If you Press Attack to the first attack you make in the round, it does not count against your reaction for the round.

#### Riposte
Once per round, if you parry an attack and that attack would have been a critical failure, you may perform a melee attack against that foe.  
Additionally, each level of training in your weapon grants you a +1 to your Parry attempts.

#### Skilled Defense
If you are attacked with a weapon or unarmed attack and have a greater total level of training than the attacker, you may use your reaction to prevent them from gaining any benefits of their training. If you have the same level of training, you may choose to prevent them from gaining one specific benefit from their training.

#### Warrior Mastery
Midan has trained well with his weapons, giving him the equivalence of an additional level of training in the handaxe. He gains the benefit listed below.

##### **Table**: *Warrior Mastery*
| Weapon                 | Benefit      |
|------------------------|-----------|
|                        |           |
| Greatsword             | When you cleave with this weapon, you do not have disadvantage on attacks made within less than half of the weapon's range and may choose to extend the arc to 270 degress (your front and both sides). If you do, you may choose to either suffer a level of fatigue, become prone until the end of the next round, or become vulnerable until the end of the next round. |
| Pike                   | When you stand to a charge against a foe, its remaining movement (in feet) is divided by the points of success of your attack. Any result below 1 results in it being stopped. If the result is below .5, you may push it back a number of feet equal to your points of success divided by their lost movement (in feet). |
| Pole Axe               | You may choose to incur a penalty to your attack up to -4. If you do, for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit, the attack is treated as having a +2 for each point of penalty incurred this way so long as the attack hits. |
