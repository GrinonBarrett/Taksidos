Put 2-5 characters in a 19x28 arena. Each space represents a single yard. Objective is to be the only one remaining.

Though a board will be used to track the players, it will be described to the players as though it were theater of the mind.

PLayers may use anything in the character's equipment or inventory, though weight limits should be considered. Also, a Horse might be a bit impractical here.

Given the nature of the combat rules, I expect these will be short skirmishes.
