## Places

### Alnuskogs
A place between places. A world primarily dominated by alder forest, though there do seem to be some carrs. It is perpetually dusk and fog shrouds the view of the distance. A few creatures live here, but is mostly inhabited and guarded by the Alderolves. The realm itself can function as a through space between wooded lands in other worlds.

### Vindherveil
A land of snow. It seems to have been a place of valleys, hills, and mountain at some point. Occsional abandoned stone castle and ghost towns can be discovered for those that brave the world long enugh, although something almost always takes those who linger for such time. A gatway to this realm is not a predictable thing.

## Notes for running various creatures

### Alderalv
The primary reason behind having the alderolves as creatures and not playable species is to give you access to a mysterious wild people that have no vested interest in the affairs of others in your setting. They can get most everything they want or need in the Alnuskogs. Their primary motivation behind operating outside of their realm is to investigate only the immediate areas connected to their realm and to protect it. They will never adventure or go beyond their current course because they don't need to. That said, if you were to run an adventure revolving around an intrusion into the Alnuskogs, you could give them a more human treatment.
