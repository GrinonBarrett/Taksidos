## Places

### Alnuskogs
A place between places. A world primarily dominated by alder forest, though there do seem to be some carrs. It is perpetually dusk and fog shrouds the view of the distance. A few creatures live here, but is mostly inhabited and guarded by the Alderolves. The realm itself can function as a through space between wooded lands in other worlds.

### Vindherveil
A land of snow. It seems to have been a place of valleys, hills, and mountain at some point. Occsional abandoned stone castle and ghost towns can be discovered for those that brave the world long enugh, although something almost always takes those who linger for such time. A gatway to this realm is not a predictable thing.

[Running Creatures]: # " Notes for running various creatures "

[Alderalves]: # " The primary reason behind having the alderolves as creatures and not playable species is to give you access to a mysterious wild people that have no vested interest in the affairs of others in your setting. They can get most everything they want or need in the Alnuskogs. Their primary motivation behind operating outside of their realm is to investigate only the immediate areas connected to their realm and to protect it. They will never adventure or go beyond their current course because they don't need to. That said, if you were to run an adventure revolving around an intrusion into the Alnuskogs, you could give them a more human treatment. "

[Godlike Entities]: # " Many godlike entities are unable to personally enter several planes of existence, as their power is so great that it could rip apart the plane itself, especially if multiple were to directly enter it. Therefore, they will send an avatar. A being composed of a fraction of their power (which will return when destroyed) to do their bidding and better serve as their eyes and ears. This is why some cults or servants of a deity will exist in a realm, to function on behalf of their patron and report back through prayer. 
They are categorized as Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Greater, Lesser, and Subscended.
A god does not need to be good or moral. "

[Primary Gods]: # " The highest order of gods. Their presence on any plane except the most celstial will tear them apart, an event known as cosmological sundering. A primary god could create a subscended, lesser, greater or tertiary god if it so wished- but this requires immense energy and can have unpleasent side effects. It could also turn a non-god into such a being. Primary gods can destroy tertiary gods and more feeble beings which enter their celstial plane at whim. They cannot be concerned with anything which does not exist on a godly level. Primary gods are capable of singing cosmic songs and dreaming eternal dreams."

[Secondary Gods]: # " The second highest order of gods. Their presence could still casue a cosmological sundering. This is where many of the eldritch and primordial gods stand in the universe. Their machinations extend beyond comprehensible existence. Other gods may rever these as their own patron deity. Though they use avatars to interact with more fragile planes, these still have a habit of warping the world around them. Tension is not an optional game rule when they are involved, and must be implemented. "

[Zersus]: # " A figure who seeks to control all by way of his Xanthic Sigil- for which the spell mimics. He is patient enough not to be overly aggressive in his methods, but dislikes those that interfere with them. He operates primarily through the use of his avatar (the humanoid form which possess a large eyeball for a head and has a mane composed of colorful feathers, draped in a deep yellow duster). His overall power exceeds that of Blancocha and any of Blancocha's lessors, a fact which Blancocha despises. Despite this, he takes more gratification in operating through his avatar form. Once killed, he will take note of whatever killed the avatar form and begin to manipulate events around them before sending a regenerated avatar against them. 
Most of his power is actually held in keeping the many extraplanar god-like entities occupied by one means or another. On a very rare instance, he might aide or reward those who have managed to root out a cult revolved around an eldritch god- and might even forgive them for killing one of his avatar incarnations if they do.
Those that choose to worship him seek to have their bodies transformed by his mark, to transcend their humanity in an attempt to be closer to him and live forever.

[Arazazulh]: # " A hive-mind which has acended to the point of being an eldritch god. It consumes planets with its haze, feeding the armies of its mutated servants whose form is hand shaped into one of its ''ideal forms''. It does not directly interact with others, instead allowing its servants the opportunity to overcome each world through their haze and portals. Its home realm, which contains its haze, was created by other gods as a way to placate it from consuming everything.

[Fzugah]: # " A brilliant ball of fire made sentient, it was once the sun of the only galaxy. When the other secondary gods were birthed, splitting existence into countless planes and expanding the universe an a near instantaneous flash, it become spiteful of the new order of things. Upon realizing there was an infinite existence beyond itself, it hungered to know all it could about this new paradigm. It cares little for the stability or welfare of anything else, but is no fool as to the fragility of the planes and will not personally appear where it could cause further damage.

[Tertiary Gods]: # " The third highest order of gods. Too powerful to exist on the more fragile planes in their proper form. They can, and will, safely send an avatar on their behald to represent themselves. They may also have powerful servants of their own. Most of the relevent gods of religious pantheons will fall into this category."

[Blancocha]: # " A fiendish being that seeks to corrupt moral beings and institutions. It operates by contacting the faithful during times of doubt and by elevating the selfish. It prefers its agents to each act alone, using their isolation to make its communication (and thus grasp) easier. Though not as powerful as an eldritch deity, it seeks to rival them eventually. It is not as powerful as it thinks, but is not afraid to elevate lower beings to nearly godlike status.
