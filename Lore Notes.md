###Alderskogs
A place between places. A forested world primarily, though there do seem to be some carrs. It is perpetually dusk and fog shrouds the view of the distance. A few creatures live here, but is primarily inhabited and guarded by the Alderolves. The realm itself can function as a through space between other wooded lands in other worlds.
