Could jeep the generic classes but introduce Prestige? classes. A prestige class can be acquired in place of splashing or specializing. It will change your progression to the new class, while letting you retain your previous benefits. The class only provides benefits for level 5 and above but does include some default benefits to offset losing a splash/specialize.

Classes:  
Yuvran (radiant war mage type role)  
Abriar (druid)  
Nekromanteir  
Night Champion (Lincerun equivalent to Yuvran but nomadic)
