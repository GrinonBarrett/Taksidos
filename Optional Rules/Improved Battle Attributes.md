In place of gaining a bonus to melee attack rolls for having greater [Body] and/or [Rflx], an attack adds their [Body] and [Rflx] bonuses to their attack roll totals and a defender adds their [Body] and [Rflx] bonus to their defense. Any feature which would have already done this instead further adds the attribute bonus.

###### This will see the dynamic shift to a more melee centric form of combat. It will also cause attack rolls to be more consistant, whilst making the most powerful creatures even tougher to deal with.
