The trampling unit gets a bonus to their opposed check result equal to half of the distance in yards traveled since the beginning of the round or the previous action (other than sprinting) whichever was most recent.  

If making an opposed [Body] check because the creature is standing to a charge, the defending creature will use its [Body] score in place of its [Body] bonus.

If making an opposed [Rflx] save because creature is evading the charge, the defending creature gets a bonus equal to the difference in size class.
