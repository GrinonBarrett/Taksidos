Sometimes, it can be rather fun to start from the very beginning. In such cases a character's class should be noted as having "in training" suffixed to it. Such a character gains no feature from the class save for the choice of class skill, if any. If the class offers 2 hitpoints at level 1- the character does gain one of its hitpoints from the first level of the class. When the character reaches a single experience tick, they may go to a mentor character and be granted the first level, which will bestow the remaining first-level features of the class including its heroism of +1.
