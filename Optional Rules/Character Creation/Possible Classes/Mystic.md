### Magical Art
You have learned a means of improving your magic that doesn't require the same dedicated training or study as some magical folks. Choose an attribute. Once chosen, it cannot be changed. Anytime you perform a spellcheck, you may choose to temporarily reduce your attribute by any amount to gain a bonus to your spell check equal to the points of reduction. This damage to your attributes is referred to as spellshock. You recover attribute points from spellshock at a rate of 1 per hour. A long rest recovers an additional point and a full rest recovers an additional 1d4+1 points. You also gain a skill based on which attribute you choose. If you already have that skill, you instead learn a language of your choice.  
* [Body] = Wrestling
* [Fort] = Athletics
* [Rflx] = Spellcraft
* [Will] = Volierence
* [Inte] = Lore
* [Prcp] = Burglary
* [Empy] = Carousing

### Pact
You may choose to enter into a pact with a greater power. If you do, you lose your ability to perform wyrding and instead gain a new means of spellcasting as approriate to that patron. This is optional. If the mystic opts not to take a pact, they may make the choice anytime they gain a new level.

### 2) Desperate Plea
You can attempt to call upon a greater power by devoting 5 rounds to pleading for help. This requires you take no other actions or movement during this time. Roll a d6. If the result is greater than 2, your patron's assistance manifests in the form a spell whose tier is equal to half of the result. Each time you perform a plea, you receive a -1 penalty to future plea results. This penalty is reduced each time you complete a long or full rest.

### 3) Terrifying Power
Anytime you cast a spell, you may use your reaction to take on at least 3 points of spell sickness. If you do, everything within a number of yards equal to the spell's tier + the amount of spell sickness you gained this way must succeed [Will] save or become afraid of you and your magic for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. Such a creature must use its turns to put distance between itself and you or otherwise premeptively establish some form of defense or cover against you. You may grant advantage on the save to a number of creatures you can perceive up to your heroism bonus.

### 4) Creeping Power
Anytime you cast a spell, you may use your reaction to take on at least 3 points of spell sickness. If you do, you may move up to a number of yards equal to the spell sickness you receive this way towards the target or area of the spell. You must move closer to the target/area this way. If the spell has an area, you may move to a point within it without being affected so long as your movement this way is enough to get there.

### 4) Mystic Defense
When a magical attack from a spell you know would target you, you may impose disadvantage against that attack. You must rest before doing so again.

### 6) Luminality
When you cast a spell that affects a number of creatures or objects, you may use your reaction to take on at least 2 points of spell sickness. If you do, choose one of the following:  
* You *may have those creatures/objects emit light like a torch*.
* You *may have the light within 5 yards of that creature reduced by one level*.

This lasts for a number of minutes equal to the spell sickness gained this way divided by the number of creatures/objects affected. As long as a creature is affected this way, you know how many hitpoints it has.

### 6) Difficult Magics
You gain a 1d4 bonus to counterspell checks.

### 7) Returned Force
When you are attacked by another creature, if you are casting a spell, you may use your reaction to perform *an attack against that creature by taking 2 points of spell sickness*. The attack will be of the same range and type. If their attack wass successful, you may choose to reduce your spell sickness by 1 or grant the attack a +1 bonus.

### 8) Grimming 
The bonus to spell checks you gain from staves for spells you know is increased by 1.  
So long as a creature is affected by one of your spells, and for 1 minute afterwards, you may affect its save result against a spell by an amount up to that spell's tier.

### 8) Pessimystical
You gain a bonus to your spell checks equal to your tension.†  
Anytime you lose hitpoints, you gain a bonus to your next counterspell check equal to the number of hitpoints lost this way.  
Anytime you gain tension, your spell sickness is reduced by 1.‡

###### If not playing with the Tension optional rules, † the bonus is instead equal to your missing hitpoints and ‡ you reduce the spell sickness everytime you lose hitpoints.

### 9) Expanded Magical Art
You may now reduce attributes other than what you chose for your Magical Art feature to gain the benefits of the spellshock, but must reduce such an attribute by 2 for every +1 benefit to be gained this way.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as a mystic, you gain the following:  
You gain access to a pact, in addition to any you may already have. If you took one of them as a result of the Pact feature and lost your ability to perform Wyrding, you may alternatively regain the ability to perform wyrding. 

#### Splash
If you splash mystic as a member of another class, you gain the same benefits as a mystic which specializes. Additionally, you choose an attribute. It is increased by 1.

### Pacts

#### Pact of Archons
You have a connection to some extraplanar power. You may call on aspects, called an archon, of this when casting a spell. You gain a number of spell slots which determine how many spells you can cast to represent the aspects you may call on. The table below dictates how many slots and the tier of those slots. Once used, it must be recovered before casting a spell again. You recover a first tier spell slot upon completing a short rest. You recover a slot of your choice with a long rest. A full rest allows you to recover a slot of each level and all expent bonus slots.

A bonus slot is always the same tier as the bonus of the attribute you chose for your magical art.

You also may cast a single spell at a tier up to your heroism, but must complete a number of full rests equal to the spell's tier tripled before doing so again.

For all intents and purposes, the result of your spellcheck is your heroism + your attribute score for the attribute chosen for your magical art at the time of casting- but it is always treated as a success (or critical success if high enough). You can still use spellburn to improve this result.

You may use spell burn to provide a bonus to counterspell checks.

|  **9** | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | - |
| **10** | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

#### Pact of Blood
You have a means of casting spells by making an offering of blood (or other symbol of lifeforce). To do so, you must sacrifice a hitpoint. You then perform a spellcheck (as normal) with a DV of 4 times the spell's tier.  
You may also choose to take on a wound, choosing any wound which is not a Glancing Blow. If you do, you may either add 1d10 to your result or add 1d4 + the bonus from the attribute selected for your Magical Art feature.  
The spell sickness you recieve from critically failing a spell is reduced to one, but you roll a number of wound rolls equal to the tier of the spell -1. Any valid result is a wound you receive. If the result is not vaild, simply ignore that roll.  
Anytime you receive a wound, you get a +1 bonus to your next spell check within the next minute. This is cumulative with multiple wounds.

If you have no hitpoints remaining, you may opt to perform an incapacitation save (even if you are normally immue to such saves). If you succeed in any degree, you choose a wound, choosing any wound which is not a Glancing Blow. You take the selected wound. This will suffice as a replacement for your sacrifice of a hitpoint.

#### Pact of Epochs
Your spell casting power comes from some anciant source. When you attempt to cast a spell, you roll a number of dice up to your heroism. These dice may be d4s, d6s, or d8s (your choice). Total the sum together to determine your spell check result. You do not add your heroism to the spell check. You then receive spell sickness equal to the highest die result plus the total number of dice you rolled. If you already have spell sickness, you may roll a single d10 and or a single d12, with each replacing one of the dice you would normally roll.

#### Pact of Mana
You have a connection to some extraplanar pool of power. You have a pool of mana points equal to your level, plus your heroism, plus your bonus from your attribute chosen for your Magical Art feature, minus your points of spell sickness. When you cast a spell, you do not perform a spellcheck, instead you roll a number of d4s equal to the tier of the spell. If the result is equal to or lower than your current pool, the result is decucted from your pool and your successfully cast the spell as though you had a spell check whose points of success was equal to the mana points lost this way. If you do not have enough mana points to cast the spell, you lose mana points equal to the spells tier and are considered to have critically failed the casting with the points of failure being equal to the neccessary mana points for that casting.  
You recover 1d4+1 mana points with a short rest, 2d6+2 points of mana with a long rest, and 1d12+8 points of mana with a full rest. If you still have spell sickness while resting, keep this in mind when determining how many mana points you can recover.  

If you cast a wyrding while you have the Pact of Mana, you may spend mana points on a spell check to gain a bonus equal to the mana points spent this way- up to your bonus from your chosen attribute with your Magical Art feature.

#### Pact of Rǣdening
You do not have the ability to innately cast spells. You must instead have access to a tome and at least half of you limbs to hold it and peform gestures. You may perform wyrdings of any spell in a grimoire (or similar reference) so long as it is sufficient materials to learn from, but cannot learn from it. When performing a wyrding this way, you gain a bonus to the spell check equal to the tier the spell is recorded as in the material. When you attempt to cast the spell, you may cast it at any tier from its minimum tier up to the tier it is recorded as plus the bonus of the attribute selected for your Magical Art feature.    
If you also possess a staff which contains the spell you are attempting to cast, you also gain the bonus normally given to one that knows the spell using the staff. 

#### Pact of Rites
You have learned how to perform religious rites like a cleric. Each rite functions as a spell with a few differences;  
* The time to cast the spell is multilpied by the tier of the spell. This increased time accounts for the motions of the ritual, performance of any incantations, the drawing of any glyphs or sigils, etc.  
* You must perform a recitation of holy scripture or mantra as you perform the spell. If you cannot hear yourself to ensure the recitation is proper, or are struggling to focus on the recitation, you have disadvantage on the spellcheck. If you cannot perform the recitation, you fail to cast the spell.  
* You must have components (such as incense, an offering of wealth or food, etc.) whose $ value is the tier of the spell squared, multiplied by 10. Such things must be considered lost as a tribute for fear of incurring divine wrath. The exact nature of the tribute depends on the rite and is at the narrator's discretion.  
* Any spell sickness you would recieve is reduced by 1.  
* A critical success will increase the tier of the cast spell by 1.  
* A critical failure has a 50% chance not to apply its critical failure effect.  

You may learn rites from your faith independant of spells. Learning rites takes as much time as learning a new spell otherwise. The time to learn a rite is divided by 10 if you know the associated spell. When you take this pact, you learn a rite of a spell whose minimum tier is no greater than your heorism and a tier of a spell whose minimum tier is 1 or 2.

#### Pact of the Surge
You have been granted the power to access an unpredictable magical force that sweeps through the background of all existence. You have access to a number of random basic spells equal to your herosim. You cast them as wyrdings like normal. When you perform any kind of rest, the spells are replaced. You will not know what spells you have access to when you perform a short rest. When you perform a long rest, you know half of the spells you have access to. Upon completing a full rest you know all spells you have access to. You may spend 45 whole minutes concentrating to identify one of the spells you have access to.  
Additionally, you may attempt to cast a random basic spell. Choose one of the folowing dice (d4, d6, or d8). You know what the spell is after you select the die, but before it is rolled. You may choose not to contiue the attempt at csting the spell at this pont or continue. The spell is cast at that tier and is considered to have a number of points of success equal to the die result plus your heroism. If the result is lower than the minimum tier, it is instead treated as a critical failure automatically. You must perform a full rest before attempting to do so again, even if you opted not to cast that spell.  
Furthermore, anytime you perform a spellcheck or counterspell check, if it is a success- you gain a bonus equal to your herosim for the purpose of determining if it is a critical success. If it was a failure, you suffer a penalty equal to your heroism for the purpose of determining if it is a critical failure.
