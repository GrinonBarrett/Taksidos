### Magical Art
You have learned a means of improving your magic that doesn't require the same dedicated training or study as some magical folks. Choose an attribute. Once chosen, it cannot be changed. Anytime you perform a spellcheck, you may choose to temporarily reduce your attribute by any amount to gain a bonus to your spell check equal to the points of reduction. This damage to your attributes is referred to as spellshock. You recover attribute points from spellshock at a rate of 1 per hour. A long rest recovers an additional point and a full rest recovers an additional 1d4+1 points. You also gain a skill based on which attribute you choose. If you already have that skill, you instead learn a language of your choice.  
* [Body] = Wrestling
* [Fort] = Athletics
* [Rflx] = Spellcraft
* [Will] = Volierence
* [Inte] = Lore
* [Prcp] = Burglary
* [Empy] = Carousing

### Pact
You may choose to enter into a pact with a greater power. If you do, you lose your ability to perform wyrding and instead gain a new means of spellcasting as approriate to that patron. This is optional. If the mystic opts not to take a pact, they may make the choice anytime they gain a new level.

2) ### Desperate Plea
You can attempt to call upon a greater power by devoting 5 rounds to pleading for help. This requires you take no other actions or movement during this time. Roll a d6. If the result is greater than 2, your patron's assistance manifests in the form a spell whose tier is equal to half of the result. Each time you perform a plea, you receive a -1 penalty to future plea results. This penalty is reduced each time you complete a long or full rest.

### 3) Terrifying Power
Anytime you cast a spell, you may use your reaction to take on at least 3 points of spell sickness. If you do, everything within a number of yards equal to the spell's tier + the amount of spell sickness you gained this way must succeed [Will] save or become afraid of you and your magic for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. Such a creature must use its turns to put distance between itself and you or otherwise premeptively establish some form of defense or cover against you. You may grant advantage on the save to a number of creature you can perceive up to your heroism bonus.

### 4) Magi's Focus
When you perform a spell check, you may spend 2 spell points to simply use your [Will] in place of rolling the d20. If you would have had advantage on the check, you roll 1d6 and add the result. If you would have had disadvantage, you roll 1d6 and subtract it.

### 4) Resist Wands
When a wand or staff's magical attack would target you, you may impose disadvantage against that attack. You must rest before doing so again.

### 7) Counter Surge
When you are attacked by another creature, if you are not casting a spell or using your concentration, you may use your reaction to perform an attack against that creature by spending 2 spell points. The attack will be of the same range and type. If their attack was successful, your attack gains a bonus equal to your [Will] bonus.

### 8) Archmagi  
The bonus to spell checks you gain from staves for spells you know is increased by 1.
You gain a bonus to your saves against magical effects equal to your [Will] bonus.

### 8) Modify Strike
You may use your reaction to expend your use of the Resist Wands feature to grant any creature you can perceive within a number of yards equal to your level a set defense value against a magical attack. The defense would be equal to your [Will] score.

### 9) Modify Magic
You may use your reaction to expend the use of your Resist Wands feature to modify the save of a creature within a number of yards equal to your level against a magical effect by up to your [Will] bonus.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as a magi, you gain the following:  
Your pool of spell points is increased by your [Will] bonus.  
When you cast a spell using reflexive casting, you gain a bonus to your spellcheck equal to your [Will] bonus.
Choose an exotic damage type. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed. You may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to your defense against an attack of that type equal to your [Will] bonus. This does not apply to the effect of poisons or continuously acting effects.  

#### Splash
If you splash magi as a member of another class, you gain the following:  
The Magicraft feature.  
You have a pool of spell points equal to half of your level. You recover 1 on a long rest and half your missing spell points on a full rest.
