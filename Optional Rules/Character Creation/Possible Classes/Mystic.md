### Magical Art
You have learned a means of improving your magic that doesn't require the same dedicated training or study as some magical folks. Choose an attribute. Once chosen, it cannot be changed. Anytime you perform a spellcheck, you may choose to temporarily reduce your attribute by any amount to gain a bonus to your spell check equal to the points of reduction. This damage to your attributes is referred to as spellshock. You recover attribute points from spellshock at a rate of 1 per hour. A long rest recovers an additional point and a full rest recovers an additional 1d4+1 points. You also gain a skill based on which attribute you choose. If you already have that skill, you instead learn a language of your choice.  
* [Body] = Wrestling
* [Fort] = Athletics
* [Rflx] = Spellcraft
* [Will] = Volierence
* [Inte] = Lore
* [Prcp] = Burglary
* [Empy] = Carousing

### Pact
You may choose to enter into a pact with a greater power. If you do, you lose your ability to perform wyrding and instead gain a new means of spellcasting as approriate to that patron. This is optional. If the mystic opts not to take a pact, they may make the choice anytime they gain a new level.

### 2) Desperate Plea
You can attempt to call upon a greater power by devoting 5 rounds to pleading for help. This requires you take no other actions or movement during this time. Roll a d6. If the result is greater than 2, your patron's assistance manifests in the form a spell whose tier is equal to half of the result. Each time you perform a plea, you receive a -1 penalty to future plea results. This penalty is reduced each time you complete a long or full rest.

### 3) Terrifying Power
Anytime you cast a spell, you may use your reaction to take on at least 3 points of spell sickness. If you do, everything within a number of yards equal to the spell's tier + the amount of spell sickness you gained this way must succeed [Will] save or become afraid of you and your magic for a number of rounds equal to the points of failure. Such a creature must use its turns to put distance between itself and you or otherwise premeptively establish some form of defense or cover against you. You may grant advantage on the save to a number of creatures you can perceive up to your heroism bonus.

### 4) Creeping Power
Anytime you cast a spell, you may use your reaction to take on at least 3 points of spell sickness. If you do, you may move up to a number of yards equal to the spell sickness you receive this way towards the target or area of the spell. You must move closer to the target/are this way. If the spell has an area, you may move to a point within it so long as your movement this way is enough to get there.

### 4) Mystic Defense
When a magical attack from a spell you know would target you, you may impose disadvantage against that attack. You must rest before doing so again.

### 6) Luminality
When you cast a spell that affects a number of creatures or objects, you may use your reaction to take on at least 2 points of spell sickness. If you do, choose one of the following:  
* You *may have those creatures/objects emit light like a torch*.
* You *may have the light within 5 yards of that creature reduced by one level*.

This lasts for a number of minutes equal to the spell sickness gained this way divided by the number of creatures/objects affected. As long as a creature is affected this way, you know how many hitpoints it has.

### 6) Difficult Magics
You gain a 1d4 bonus to counterspell checks.

### 7) Returned Force
When you are attacked by another creature, if you are casting a spell, you may use your reaction to perform *an attack against that creature by taking 2 points of spell sickness*. The attack will be of the same range and type. If their attack wass successful, you may choose to reduce your spell sickness by 1 or grant the attack a +1 bonus.

### 8) Grimming 
The bonus to spell checks you gain from staves for spells you know is increased by 1.  
So long as a creature is affected by one of your spells, and for 1 minute afterwards, you may affect its save result against a spell by an amount up to that spell's tier.

### 8) Pessimystical
You gain a bonus to your spell checks equal to your tension.†  
Anytime you lose hitpoints, you gain a bonus to your next counterspell check equal to the number of hitpoints lost this way.  
Anytime you gain tension, your spell sickness is reduced by 1.‡

###### If not playing with the Tension optional rules, † the bonus is instead equal to your missing hitpoints and ‡ you reduce the spell sickness everytime you lose hitpoints.

### 9) Expanded Magical Art
You may now reduce attributes other than what you chose for your Magical Art feature to gain the benefits of the spellburn, but must reduce such an attribute by 2 for every +1 benefit to be gained this way.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as a mystic, you gain the following:  
You gain access to a pact magic method of spellcasting. If you took one of them as a result of the Pact feature and lost your ability to perform Wyrding, you may alternative regain the ability to perform wyrding. 

#### Splash
If you splash mystic as a member of another class, you gain the same benefits as a mystic which specializes. Additionally, you choose an attribute. It is increased by 1.

#### Pacts

##### Pact of Blood
You have a means of casting spells by making an offering of blood (or other symbol of lifeforce). To do so, you must sacrifice a hitpoint. You then perform a spellcheck (as normal) with a DV of 4 times the spell's tier.  
You may also choose to take on a wound, choosing any wound which is not a Glancing Blow. If you do, you may either add 1d10 to your result or add 1d4 + the bonus from the attribute selected for your Magical Art feature.  
The spell sickness you recieve from critically failing a spell is reduced to one, but you roll a number of wound rolls equal to the tier of the spell -1. Any valid result is a wound you receive. If the result is not vaild, simply ignore that roll.  
Anytime you receive a wound, you get a +1 bonus to your next spell check within the next minute. This is cumulative with multiple wounds.

If you have no hitpoints remaining, you may opt to perform an incapacitation save (even if you are normally immue to such saves). If you succeed in any degree, you choose a wound, choosing any wound which is not a Glancing Blow. You take the selected wound. This will suffice as a replacement for your sacrifice of a hitpoint.


##### Pact of Mana
You have a connection to some extraplanar pool of power. You have a pool of mana points equal to your level, plus your heroism, plus your bonus from your attribute chosen for your Magical Art feature, minus your points of spell sickness. When you cast a spell, you do not perform a spellcheck, instead you roll a number of d4s equal to the tier of the spell. If the result is equal to or lower than your current pool, the result is decucted from your pool and your successfully cast the spell as though you had a spell check whose points of success was equal to the mana points lost this way. If you do not have enough mana points to cast the spell, you lose mana points equal to the spells tier and are considered to have critically failed the casting with the points of failure being equal to the neccessary mana points for that casting.  
You recover 1d4+1 mana points with a short rest, 2d6+2 points of mana with a long rest, and 1d12+8 points of mana with a full rest. If you still have spell sickness while resting, keep this in mind when determining how many mana points you can recover.  

If you cast a wyrding while you have the Pact of Mana, you may spend mana points on a spell check to gain a bonus equal to the mana points spent this way- up to your bonus from your chosen attribute with your Magical Art feature.
