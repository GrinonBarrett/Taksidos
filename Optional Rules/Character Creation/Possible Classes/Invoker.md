### Conjury
The invoker may have a number of serviles that give their service to the invoker. These serviles have a special bond with the invoker. The invoker may only entreat the services of so many serviles as limited by their conjury. Once an invoker has reached this limit, they cannot acquire any additional allies of this nature. This is the total number of serviles that may serve you at any time.

### Serviles
You have a bond with a number serviles. Your serviles each get their own turn during encounters, but cannot tag with other creatures. Each servile takes their turn simultaneously. When rolling for initiative, they will always take their turn after yours. They act of their own accord, but will obey your command. Commanding any number of serviles is an action or reaction. Commanding all serviles to do the same thing counts as a single order, but otherwise each servile which is to follow an order is treated as being given an individual order. Once a servile is lost, a new one can be recruited by some means appropriate to the type of servile. You may only have lesser serviles follow you.  
Serviles function as creatures with a limited pool of hitpoints. When a servile is damaged while no hitpoints remain, it is destroyed.

### 2) Dominion
Your powers have an origin in some aspect of magic. Determine what that origin is. You and your serviles can gain benefits based on this. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed.

### 2) Engage
Once per round, you may use your reaction to impose advantage on an attack or check made by aone of your serviles which you can perceive.

### 3) Bonded
Anytime a creature within a number of yards equal to your level receives Spell-Sickness, you may use your reaction to redirect up to half of that to yourself.

### 3) Invocation
When a spell references your [Magic] score/bonus, you may use your [Prcp] score/bonus.  
Furthermore, when performing a counter-spell check, you may add your [Prcp] bonus.

### 4) Further Training
You gain training in two weapons of your choice. You may choose to learn a language in place of either training. Alternatively, you may choose to gain a skill of your choice instead of getting any training in weapons or languages.

### 6) Greater Servile
Your power and focus has honed to the point that you may have a single greater servile follow you.

### 7) Greater Dominion
The powers granted by your dominion

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
Your greater servile no longer counts against your conjury.
You gain a bonus to all spell checks equal to your [Prcp].
Your serviles gain a bonus to all saves equal to your [Empy] bonus.

#### Splash
If you splash invoker as a member of another class, you gain the following:  
You may have a single lesser servile. You are considered to have a conjury value of 1.  
You also gain the Invocation feature.

#### Dominions

##### The Earth {WiP}
Your power comes from the land itself. You may do one of the following:  
• As a reaction, when you are struck by a non-magical attack, you may take on 1d4 points of spell sickness. If you do, *you gain a bonus to your defense against that attack equal to double the result*.  
• Once per encounter, when you are standing on firm ground and would be made prone, you are not prone.  
##### Greater Dominion of The Grave
• You gain a bonus to defense against cold and fire attacks equal to your Heroism.  
• When one of your serviles inflicts a critical hit with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to inflict a fire attack against that foe.

##### The Flame
Your power comes from the burning in your soul. You may do one of the following:  
• As an action or reaction, you may choose to receive 1d8 points of spell sickness. If you do, *you exhale flames in a manner identical to the Dragon's Breath spell cast at minimum level*.  
• As an action, you may *create a harmless flame in your hand which can produce light like a torch. It ceases to exist when you stop concentrating on it*.  
##### Greater Dominion of The Flame
• You gain a bonus to defense against cold and fire attacks equal to your Heroism.  
• When one of your serviles inflicts a critical hit with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to inflict a fire attack against that foe.  

##### The Grave
Your power comes from the veil of life and death itself. You may do one of the following:  
• As an action, you may target an undead or ephemeral creature which can perceive you and which you can perceive. Perform an opposed [Will] check. If you have a success, it is dazed until the end of the next round. If you have a critical success, it is vulnerable during this time.  
• As an action, you may take on a point of spell sickness. If you do, choose a number of creatures equal to your heroism who are within 3 yards of each other. They suffer a -1 to all attack rolls, checks, and saves until the end of then next round. Additionally, Necrotic, Radiant, and Undamaging attacks agianst them gain a +1 bonus.  
##### Greater Dominion of The Grave
• You gain a bonus to defense against necrotic and toxic attacks equal to your Heroism.  
• When you inflict a critical hit with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to inflict a necrotic attack against that foe.  
• When you would be killed, you may give one final command to your serviles using your reaction.

##### The Light
Your path has been illuminated by some higher power. You may do one of the following:  
• As an action, you may target a fiend or ephemeral creature which can perceive you and which you can perceive. Perform an opposed [Will] check. If you have a success, it is dazed until the end of the next round. If you have a critical success, it is vulnerable during this time.  
• As a reaction whenever a creature within a number of yards equal to your level performs a save, you may take on a point of spell sickness. If you do, that creature gains a bonus to the save equal to your conjury minus the number of your entreated serviles. 
##### Greater Dominion of The Light
• You gain a bonus to defense against necrotic and radiant attacks equal to your Heroism.  
• When you inflict a critical hit with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to inflict a radiant attack against that foe.  
• When you would be killed, you may explode with light out to a number of yards equal to your heroism. Any ephemera or fiend is subject to a radiant attack, which will leave the creature prone if successful instead of inflicting a wound (critical hits still apply the appropriate effect). If it impacts against any other creature, you may choose to have it inflict an undamaging attack with disadvantage. If successful, it restores a hitpoint. This explosion produces bright light within its area, and fair light an additional 10 yards beyond that, which lasts until the end of the next round.

##### Valdercaller
You have been chosen by nature to defend its peace. You may do the following:  
• As an action you may change your creature type to become Fey or Sylven. This lasts for a number of minutes equal to your level multiplied by your herosim. While affected by this, you are fluent in the Wild Tongue and all undamaging attacks against you have disadvantage. You must rest before doing so again.  
• As a reaction, you may take on a point of spell-sickness to fire a thorn from yourself or a nearby plant. This inflicts a thrown blade attack against a foe within a number of yards equal to your level.
##### Greater Dominion of the Valdercaller 
• Your maximum hitpoints are increased by 1.
• You may take on 10 points of spell-sickness as an action to call forth a flurry of whipping vines and thorny missiles. This inflicts a piercing attack and either a cutting attack or another piercing attack (your choice) against each creature in a 7 yard cone extending out from your hand. You must comple a long or full rest before doing so again.
• Choose an exotic damage type, all attacks of that manner have disadvantage against you. Once this decision is made, you must complete 7 full rests to change it.

###### Will also have an invoker for each of the four classical elements and a warlord.
