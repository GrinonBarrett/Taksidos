### Martial Rejoinder
Whenever an attack of opportunity, a feint attack attack (initial or secondary roll), or cleave attack against you is a critical failure, you may do one of the following;  
* You may perform a melee attack against that creature if it is within range.
* You may move 1 yard.
* You may leap.
* If you are not prone or vulnerable, you may fall prone to recover the use of your reaction for the round.
* You may become braced to dodge.
* If you are prone (but not for a set time), you may right yourself from it.
* If you are brawling with a creature, you may shove it.

### Reckless
If you are vulnerable, but not prone, your follow up attacks do not have disadvantage.

### Rollout
When you are made prone, you may use your reaction to perform a move.

### 2) Blenching
When you recoil, you may instead shift the wound result a number of steps equal to your heroism. If you are a species which does not receive the effect of wounds, you instead get an additional +1 bonus to defense when you dodge.

### 2) Defumble
When you are shoved while prone, you may use your reaction to no longer be prone.

### 2) Forward Momentum
When your movement results in a brawl, if you moved the entirety of your movement (either a typical mode of movement or sprint) since the beginning of the round- you may use your reaction to grant yourself a bonus to your checks equal to 1/3 the distance in yards you moved since the start of the round or your previous action (whichever is most recent) to either the [Body] or [Rflx] check. If you do, and that check is a critical failure, you are vulnerable until the end of the round.

### 3) Sliding Recovery
When you are knocked back while prone for a set period of time, you may reduce the total remaining number of rounds you are prone by the number of yards you are knocked back.

### 3) Squirmy
You add your heroism to attempts to break free from a grapple.

### 3) Woozy Way
When you are obtunded, you have the following features;  
* When you are attacked, roll a d4. If the result is even, it is a bonus to your defense. If it is odd, it is a penalty.
* When you perform a check, attack roll, or [Rflx] save, roll a d8. If it is even, it is a bonus. If it is odd, its a penalty.

### 4) Bounce Off
When a foe attempts a melee attack against you and that attack would have been a critical success or a critical failure, you may shove or slam that foe.  

### 4) Pain That You're Used To
When you receive a wound roll result that is the same as one you have, which is no longer valid, you do not reroll the result. Instead you receive a wound with no effect.  
If you are a species that does not receive effects of wounds, you instead gain a +1 to defense against the next attack of the same type as what caused the wound.

### 6) Bear It
When an attack against you is successful, you may use your reaction to lower the points of success by an amount equal to your heroism for the purpose of determinng if it is a critical hit.

### 7) Astounding Resilience
Anytime you make a save, you may choose to roll with intensity (per the optional rule). If you do, and the die result is below 10, you gain a +2 bonus to your result.

### 7) Defense in Guess
When an attack is inflicted against you, you may call a number. If the attack roll result is the number you called, you gain a +3 bonus to defense against that attack.

### 8) Deathless Will
If you are hemorhhaging, obtunded, or stuporous when rolling an incapacitation save- you may call a number. If the roll result is the number you called, you gain a bonus to your save equal to your heroism.  
The amount of inebriation required to incapacitate you is increased by your current hitpoints.

### 8) Moment of Clarity
Once, when performing a check, you may opt not to roll the standard 3d6. If you do, you use your current level of inebriation and your heroism as your result. You may still benefit from skills and other bonuses. You must complete a full rest before doing so again.

### 9) Unbreakable
Each time an attack against your is successful, you gain a +1 bonus to defense until the end of the next round.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
If you specialize as a desultor, you gain the following:  
You gain training in unarmed attacks and a weapon of your choice. Then you gain a training of your choice.  
Your follow up attacks and counter attacks gain a bonus equal to the level of training you have with the appropriate weapon/unarmed for the purpose of inflicting a critical hit.  
When you perform an attack, you may roll a d4. If the result is a 4, your attack is automatically a critical failure with a total attack result of 1. Otherwise, you gain a bonus to the attack equal to the result.

#### Splash
If you splash desultor as a member of another class, you gain the following benefits:  
You gain the Reckless and Squirmy features.  
When you recoil, you may modify the wound by 1 additional step.  
You gain training in a weapon of your choice.
