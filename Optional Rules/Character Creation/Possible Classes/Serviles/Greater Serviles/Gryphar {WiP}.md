**Limited Flight Capacity**: A hippalectryon can only fly for a number of minutes equal to 5 + [Fort] bonus between rests. Flying with a medium load counts as double the time. Flying with a heavy load counts as quadruple the load.

**Flyby Trample**: If the hippalectryon tramples a foe while flying, they may choose to inflict a cutting attack in place of a crushing attack.
