#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the animate skeleton has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  
**-** Does not have Hitpoints. Instead, it has points of undeath which must be exhausted before it is destroyed. Anytime an attack against this creature is successful, the creature loses a number of these points equal to the attack's total. Once the total is reduced to 0 or below, it is destroyed. A long rest restores half of the missing points of undeath. A full rest restores half again as many points of undeath as the long rest.

**Mindless**: Animate skeletons do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing affects and fear-based effects.

**Barebone Senses**: The skeleton is devoid of organs to sense, but can sense the vibrations in its bones- essentially giving it a sense of hearing and touch.

**Dominion Benefits**: The lamporb gains the benefit as appropriate to your domain.  
* **The Grave**. Immunity to necrotic damage.
* **The Light**: The Lamporb's Ambient light's ranges are each increased by half.
* **Valdercaller**. Undamaging attacks have disadvantage against the Lamporb.
