#### Special Features

**Undead Nature**: As an undead creature, the ergenekrai has a few advantages:  
**-** They do not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. Rest occurs when they are inactive.  
**-** Immunity to poisons, venoms, diseases, fatigue, bloodloss, and effects which instantly kill unless they specifically affect undead.  
**-** Cannot be incapacitated, except by an effect which explicitly affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be healed by an effect unless it specifically affects undead.  
**-** Cannot be destroyed by massive damage.  
**-** Does not produce warmth.  

**Mindless**: Ergenekrai do not have capacity for independent thought. As such, they cannot participate in articulate thought or coordination. They are also unaffected by mind-influencing affects and fear-based effects.

**Barebone Senses**: The ergenekrai is devoid of organs to sense, but can sense the vibrations in its bones- essentially giving it a sense of hearing and touch. It can always see its invoker with its eye holes if nothing lies between them and will always understand the voice of its invoker.

**Dominion Benefits**: The ergenekrai gains the benefit as appropriate to your domain.  
* **The Earth**. Immune to damage from knockback (but not falling).
* **The Flame**. When destroyed, a small explosion can be directed.
* **The Grave**. Ki, Necrotic, and Radiant attacks each have disadvantage against the ergenekrai.
* **The Light**: The ergenekrai can seee light levels (but not actually see) and can "feel" light levels in addition to its standard senses. It cannot be blinded by theses senses.
* **Nobility**. The ergenekrai gains proficiency with a random weapon. If it is proficient with a one handed weapon, it can use a buckler in its off hand.
* **The Sea**. Swim speed is increased by 2 yards.
* **The Sky**. Immune to damage from falling (but not knockback).
* **Valdercaller**. If the ergernkrai is grappling a foe, it can treat its attacks against that foe as being Toxic or Biting. Any critical hit with an unarmed attack dealt be the ergenekrai can be treated as toxic.

#### Gaining an Ergernekrai Servile

By casting the Animate spell on a relatively fleshless skeleton at 3rd tier, if it is a critical success- the invoker may choose to entreat the ensuing Animate Skeleton as an Ergenekrai instead.
