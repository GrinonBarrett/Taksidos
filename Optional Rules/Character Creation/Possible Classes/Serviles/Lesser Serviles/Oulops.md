#### Special Features

**Unusual Servile**: The oulops does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe and does not bleed. It must still relax to rest.

**Wispy Nature**: The oulops cannot be trampled or brawl with any creature more than 2 size categories larger than itself.

**Gust**: The oulops can *produce a 3 yard fan shaped gust. Anything within the gust is knocked back a number feet equal to 50 divided by its weight in stones*. It must complete a long or full rest before doing so again.

**Cyclonic Guard**: Any non-magical ranged attack which critically fails against the oulops is instead directed to a new target of the oulops' choice. The target must be within the attack's remaining range.

**Change Size**: The oulops may increase in size up to 15 feet in height, allowing it to be a small, medium, or large creature. When doing so, it cause everything within a certain distance to spin around itself 90 degrees and be pushed out a number of yards equal to the invoker's heroism divided by the creature/object's weight in stones as it is thrown by the forming wind currents. This size increase lasts for a number of rounds equal to the invoker's heroism minus the number of size categories gained this way. The aura reaches out 1 foot if small, 1 yard if medium, or 1.5 yards if large. In place of performing a crushing attack when it tramples in this form, the oulops causes a creature to be made prone.  
It must perform a full rest before doing so.

**Dominion Benefits**: The oulops gains the benefit as appropriate to your domain.  
* **Chosen Spirit**. Anytime it tramples, the Oulops may treat it as a Ki attack.
* **The Earth**. The oulops has an aura extending out 1 foot of dust carried on its gentle swirling breeze. Any ranged attack passing through the aura suffers a -1 to the attack roll. This extends to its aura when using its change size feature.
* **The Flame**. The oulops emits an aura of dry heat. Anytime it knocks a foe back, fire attacks gain advantage against that foe until the end of the next round.
* **The Grave**. Movement speed increased by 1 yard.
* **The Light**. The oulops can manipulate the light around its translucent body, allowing it to become invisible for a number of rounds up to the invoker's level. It must complete a full rest before doing so again.
* **Nobility**. The oulops can assist the invoker in operating magical vehicles, providing a +1 bonus to volierence checks.
