#### Gaining a Lamporb Servile

Lamporbs can be called from their native plain by an invoker who fully rests for 20 days, keeping a clean burning lamp lit outside their door for the entirety of the time. If the invoker acts in a benevelent or mild manner during this time, they may see it in the distance. After a day, if they leave and return, they will find the lamprob willing to join their retinue.
