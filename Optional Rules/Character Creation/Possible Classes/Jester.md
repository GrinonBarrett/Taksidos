# Jester
A class much maligned by many a narrator, the jester is the sort of character who causes chaos in their presence. The entire class may be "reflavored" to be more serious despite performing unusual deeds, but most players choosing this class will opt for comedy.

### Buffoonery
You are capable of some of the most ridiculous antics imaginable. Just how outlandish the actual antics are varies from jester to jester, but you are always capable of something unorthodox. You may reduce your heroism to perform some buffonery. Each expenditure of buffoonery reduces your heroism by 1. When you perform a short rest, you recover a point of your heroism. When you complete a long rest, you recover half of your maximum heroism. When you complete a full rest, you recover all of your heroism.

### Jesting
You can communicate by using your entire body in place of speech. This requires an entire round and that you not be restrained. When you do so, you may set a DV up to your level + [Inte] score. A creature observing the movements can make an [Inte] or [Prcp] check (their choice) to decipher the meaning of the movements. You may convey a single sentence per round. Additionally, if you can perceive the creature, you may give a single creature advantage on their check to understand you. You may expened buffoonery to grant a creature a advantage on their check as well.

Another Jester may add their level to their check for the purpose of understanding your jesting.

### On-On
You may tag any creature, even if it does not agree to the tag. When you do, you may use your reaction to call out "No tagbacks!", preventing them from targeting you for attacks or spells for the remainder of the round. They can still use features and actions which affect an area that happens to include you.

### Tickle
You may use your action or reaction to expend buffonery while being grappled to force the grappler to make a [Fort] or [Rflx] save (your choice). If the save is a failure, the grapple is released. If the save is a critical failure, they are also vulnerable until the end of the next phase. If the save is a critical success, the creature is not only unaffected, but will not be affected by further attempts. The DV of the save is your level + your heroism.  
You may also tickle a creature which is grappling another if you are unrestrained.

### 2) Flashback
When performing a check/save, if the result is a failure or a critical failure, you may reattempt it by explaining a scenario in which you had actually prepared for the original result. If the narrator deems your explaination remotely in tone for the scenario, perform a new check/save. You must complete a full or long rest before doing so again.

### 2) Journeyman
The number of items you may learn from individual learning is doubled.

### 3) Jack of All Trades
Anytime you perform a check involving a skill with which you are not proficient, you gain a +1 bonus to your check. Additionally, you may expend buffoonery to reroll the lowest die of your roll. You may only do so once per check.

### 3) Jape
As an action, you may express some witty retort or one-liner targeted at a creature which can hear you. It must succeed a [Will] save with a DV equal to your level + heroism  + an attribute bonus which the narrator deems appropriate to the particular jape or have its attention focused on a subject you dictate as appropriate to the jape. If it is a critical failure, it is also dazed until end of round. You are vulnerable until the end of the round. You may expend buffonery to do this as a reaction.  
Mindless creatures are immune to this and any creature which does not understand the spoken language gets advantage on its save.

### 3) Jugglier
You gain training in one of the following weapons (thrown blades, brusgiata, chakram). You gain a +1 bonus to attacks rolls, checks, and saves involving hurlings.  
Choose an exotic damage type. Anytime an attack of that type would be influcted against you and fail, you may use your reaction or expend buffoonery to harmlessly roll it into a palm shaped sphere you can juggle. This sphere lasts for 1 minute. You may use it to inflict a melee attack of the same type within your unarmed range or throw it up to a number of yards equal to the greatest of either your [Body] or [Rflx] score + level, with the optimal range being a number of yards equal to your level.   
If an attack rolled into a sphere would have inflicted another effect other than wounding, it will apply that effect.  
You must maintain some movement to keep juggling the items, requiring you forfeit an action during an action phase, a movement, or your reaction each round.  
You may only juggle a number of spheres equal to 1+ your heroism.

### 4) Distraction
When a creature which you can perceive, and which can perceive you, attempts to perform a skill check- you may expend buffonery to impose a d4 penalty to that check as an action or reaction. You may do so as many times as you wish to a single check.

### 4) Shenanigans
You may expend buffonery to perform some special ability. You may use any shenanigan this way so long as you are proficient with the associated skill. Unless otherwise noted, such a thing is an action.

### 6) Hasty
You add your level to your initiative roll.

### 6) Jugglist
You can now juggle incoming thrown blades, chakram, and brusgiata with your juggling. It does not convert them into a sphere, but they can be hurled in the same manner as one of your spheres if thrown within a minute while being juggled.  
If you have warrior mastery with any weapons, you can apply it to your jugglier sphere. You cannot apply an inappropriate warrior mastery to a weapon this way. 

### 7) Shennanigannery
You may perform a shenanigan without expending buffonery. You must rest before doing so again.  

### 7) Stand-Out Performance
Anytime you perform a shenannigan, you may increase or reduce the spell-sickness of a creature within 3 yards by 1 so long as it already had spell-sickness.

### 8) Ungovernable
When you perform a save, you may expend buffoonery to gain a bonus equal to your heroism.

### 9) Encore
When you perform a reaction, you may expend buffoonery to be braced for the same type of reaction.

### 9) Outrageous
Anytime a creature's attack, check, or save is a success but not a critical success- you may use your reaction to expend buffonery to change that result to either a critical success or critical failure. You and that creature must be able to perceive each other for this to work.

### Splash or Specialize
At levels 5 and 10, you may choose to splash another class into your training or choose instead to specialize. If you already specialized, you must splash.

#### Specialize
Anytime you tag with an ally, you recover a point of heroism lost to buffonery. Additionally, if an ally understands your jesting, you may tag with them as part of the jest.
You may use your Shenannigannery feature to perform a shenanigan associated with a skill you are not proficient with.  
You learn a language of your choice.  
You gain training in a weapon of your choice.  
You may expend buffoonery as an action or reaction to increase or reduce another creature's spell-sickness by 1d6+1. You must be able to physically touch the creature to affect it.

#### Splash
If you splash jester as a member of another class, you gain the following:  
You gain a language of your choice, training in a weapon of your choice, the Shenanigannery feature, and Jack of All Trades feature.

#### Shenanigans

**• Alchemy**: You may pretend to drink a mixture, hold it for a number of rounds up to your [Fort] score, then spew it on another within 1 yard- causing them to be affected. You must succeed an undamaging ranged attack to successfully affect another creature.

**• Animal Empathy**: You give an animal a single sentance of information in a manner similar to your jesting, accompanied by strange noises.

**• Athletics**: You tumble or move in an otherwise unorthodox manner. Treat as a jump which ignores usual impediments of terrain and does not count towards distance fallen. An attack of opportunity against you for this movement has disadvantage.

**• Burglary**: You modify a trap or lock which you have already bypasssed to have its DV changed to any number up to your level + your heroism.

**• Carousing**: You cause such a distraction that anyone not engaged in battle immediately has their attention turned to you. Anyone in battle must succeed a [Will] save with a DV equal to your level + your heroism or have its concentration lost and attention turned to you.

**• Carpentry**: You manage to work a random wooden object into an improvised weapon until the end of the encounter. It can be used as a club to attack and also functions as a buckler until it is damaged.

**• Cartage**: You perform a cartage check, for a number of rounds equal to the result, the vehicle and its contents may be treated as having half of its weight or half again of its weight.

**• Cooking**: You make a food item of some sort (soup, pie, etc.) which can be thrown as though it were a thrown blade (for determining ranges) and used to inflict an undamaging attack. Instead of inflicting a wound, the foe is dazed or prone, you choice. If the attack was a critical hit, they are subject to both. They remain so until they spend an action cleaning themselves.

**• Fabrication**: You create a disguise out of various garb which can make you appear like a generic NPC of a similar species (or another) which requires a successful [Prcp] check to determine is false. This requires 120 minutes divided by your [Inte] score. The DV of the check is equal to your level + your heroism. The narrator may also apply bonus to the DV based on how the scenario plays out, granting an ability bonus to it.

**• Helmsmanship**: Flip a coin. If heads, you manage to increase the turn radius of the ship by 20%. If tails, you increase the speed of the ship by 20%. A musical number should accompany this. This lasts for as long as you are engaged in the action and for a number of rounds equal to your level (up to your level squared or the time it takes to finish the musical number).

**• Jewelcraft**: You manage to turn a piece of jewelry into a type of weapon. Treat as either a club, thrown blade, sling, or buckler until the end of the encounter.

**• Lore**: You figure out a very unusual property of an item. The narrator rolls to see what unusual property the item has. It has this property for a number of units of time equal to your level + your heroism. You may choose to have the units of time be rounds, minutes, or hours- but do so before finding out what the property is. You must then explain either why the item has that property or enlighten everyone to the backstory of the item.

**• Masonry**: You completely bypass some work of stone whose thickness in inches is no greater than your level + your heroism. If it was solid, you crash or tunnel through it somehow, leaving a hole for others to pass through. The hole may destablize the work.

**• Medicine**: You loose a joke or concoct an anecdote. If it is actually funny, that creature gains advantage on the next save they make against a physical affliction.
 
**• Merchantry**: You know how many hitpoints a creature has, so long as it is less than your level + heroism. You also know how much their outfit and equipped gear costs.
 
**• Riding**: You charge with your mount recklessly, moving the mount at max speed for the entire round (it must move at max speed using one of its movement modes during both movement phases). During this time, you may add your heroism to your Riding checks in place of gaining your proficiency die. At the end of the round, you jump. For this purpose, you jump is doubled and does not count towards your falling distance. You may theoretically jump in such a way as to land back in the saddle.
  
**• Roping**: You use your rope to lasso a foe. Perform an undamaging attack against a foe within the length of the rope, up to a number of yards equal to your level + your [Rflx] bonus. If successful, the foe is prone and functionally grappled until an action is spent removing the rope. On a critical success, you manage to restrain the foe fully, leaving them vulnerable until the end of the round.
 
**• Smithy**: You cobble together some makeshift armor which functions for a number of minutes equal to your level. You need a number of pounds of material equal to 40 minus your [Inte] score + your heroism. At least one-third of this needs to be metal. Treat as cuirass, but attacks have advantage against one wearing it. This requires 1d4+6 rounds to put together.
   
**• Spellcraft**: You attempt to counterspell a spell being cast which you do not recognize. This functions as a normal counterspell-check.
 
**• Survival**: Perform a survival check. Divide the points of success by 5. This is how many portions of food or liquid you produce (of a nature determined by the narrator). You must explain why you had it and may or may not want to explain where you hid it. The narrator may change the exact nature of such items afterwards.

**• Tannery**: You cobble together an improvised form of armor which is treated as gambeson and lasts for a number of minutes equal to your level + your herosim. You need a number of pounds of material equal to 20 minus your level. At least one-third of this needs to be leather or quilted material. This requires 1d8+2 rounds to put together.

**• Volierence**: You cause the vehicle to move again as an action, but suffer disadvantage on checks and saves pertaining to controlling the vehicle until the end of the round. If you do so twice in a round, you extend the penalty to the next round.
  
**• Wrestling**: You use your reaction to be treated as having a critical success in addition to any actual results of a brawl's opposed checks.

**• Zoology**: Use as a reaction in response to meeting a creature of the approriate creature type. Perform a zoology skill check which is compared to a save by the creature. If successful, you have the creature either ignore you (particularly if it is mindless) or alter the intensity of the creature's emotion by one degree. You may affect a group of creatures with this, but each additional creature decreases your check result by 1.
