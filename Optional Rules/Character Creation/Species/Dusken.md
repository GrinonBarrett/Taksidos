### Special Features

**Shadowy**: Dusken are creatures of shadow and as a result possess a few traits which make them difficult to deal with;    
The dusken exists where the light does not touch, this means they may only exist in a constant state of darkness.  
 • So long as it does not end the round in it, the dusken may use its movement to cross illuminated areas.  
 • Dusken are unaffected by darkness and can see in it as though it were fair light.  
 • If a dusken is somehow trapped in light, it treats bright light as most creatures would treat darkness. It treats fair and dim light as most creatures would treat dim light. It will also become dazed while it is trapped in the light.   
 • Non-magical forms of damage have no effect on the dusken.  
 • The dusken cannot be grappled, restrained, or made prone by any non-magical means.  
 • The dusken ignores all ethereal/material armor when attacking a creature which is in dim light or no light at all using its unarmed attack.  
 • A dusken ignores a target’s cover from objects when it strikes a foe with its unarmed attack.  
 • Dusken make no sound when they move.  
 • Dusken cast no shadow or reflection when observed.  
 • Dusken do not need to eat or drink.  
 • Dusken only gain a full or long rest's benefits if they have a portion of food or a serving of fluid which was given to them unsolicted from a non-dusken. They cannot inform others of this by any means. During the rest, the offering is either consumed or simply fades from existence.  
 • You gain no benefit from armor but are still burdened by it.  
 • You have a Attack versus Creature table which outlines your defense against each kind of attack.  
 • Immunity to damage from falling and knockback.  
 • Immunity to all poisons, venom, and diseases.  
 • Immunity to the effects of bloodloss.  
 • Immunity to effects that affect flesh.  
 • Immunity to fatigue. This prevents you from taking on fatigue as a cost to use class features, actions, or magic items.  
 • Immunity to sleep.  
 • Immunity to effects which cause asphyxiation.  
 • Immunity to incapacitation. Instead you can be destroyed as outlined below.  
 • You cannot cross over or otherwise traverse running water.  
 • Damage from radiant sources reduces the maximum hitpoints of a dusken rather than dealing damage. The dusken regains 1 of these per a short rest, 3 per a long rest, and all per a full rest. 

**Senseless**: Effects that rely on stimuli such as pleasure or pain have no effect on the dusken. It still has the function of its senses, but does not process sensations as “painful” or “pleasurable” nor is it overwhelmed by intensive stimulation. It simply receives stimuli.

**Destroying a Dusken**: A dusken character has twice as many hitpoints as a character might normally. A dusken does not receive wounds from successful attacks as normal creatures, instead they are simply destroyed when an attack is successful against them while they have no hitpoints remaining.

###### If a Dusken character is an invoker, treat it as having a single hitpoint total until it would be granted hitpoints by class or another feature.
