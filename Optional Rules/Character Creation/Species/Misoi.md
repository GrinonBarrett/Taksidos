### Special Features

**Forgotten Past**: Your narrator selects 2 skills. When you attempt to use a selected skill, it will be revealed that you have proficiency in it.

**Ephemeral Nature**: Misoi are barely corporeal and exist in a state which allows it to occupy space with other forms of matter. As such they   
 • Do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.  
 • Misoi enter an "ephemeral absence" to rest. They may choose how long to rest this way before entering the ephemeral absence.  
 • Have disadvantage on [Body] checks.  
 • Are immune to diseases, poisons and venom including toxic damage.  
 • Are not affected by spells which would affect flesh.  
 • Are not subject to incapacitation saves.  
 • Receive wounds, but do not suffer additional effects of wounds.  
 • Cannot be healed except through rest.  
 • Have advantage on saves against effects which would grapple, restrain, or make the misoi prone unless it specifies that they affect ephemera.

**Misoi Form**: You do not gain the benefits of worn armor, but are still subject to the burdens of it. You have a Attack versus Creature table which outlines your defense against each kind of attack.

**Voidtouched**: You have seen the veil and, as a result, find yourself numb to the fears of mortality. Unless specified otherwise, fear based effects cannot affect you.

**Already Dead**: You cannot be instantly killed by magic unless it specifies otherwise. A wound you receive from Necrotic sources cannot kill you, even if you fail your incapacitation save.

**Misoi Resistance**: Non-magical attacks against the misoi have disadvantage. 

**Fallproof**: A Misai ignores all damage from falling and knockback. 

**Hamering a Misai**: If it would receive a number of wounds equal to or greater than its current remaining hitpoints, it instead enters an ephemeral absence for a number of rounds equal to the total wounds it would have received.

**Ending a Misai**: You and your narrator agree on a type of damage, material, or creature type. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed. If you would be brought below 0 hitpoints, you enter an ephemeral absence for 1d20 units of time, which is determined by a d12 roll below. If the selected damage/material/creature type was used to bring you below 0 hitpoints, you are destroyed instead.  
1-3 = rounds  
4-5 = minutes  
6-7 = hours  
8 = days  
9 = weeks  
10 = fortnights  
11 = months  
12 = years
For the purpose of this feature, all melee weapons are considered a single damage type. All ranged weapons are consided a single damage type. Thrown weapons are treated as they are used (melee or ranged). Unlisted or other special weapons are their own type of damage.

**Ephemeral Absence**: When entering an ephemeral absences, the existence of the misai is suspended for the indicated amount. If intentionally entering an ehemeral absence, it is for the intended amount of time plus an additional % of time equal to 1d10.

###### Optional Rule: A narrtor might allow falling and knockback to be the sort of damage which can end the misai's existance. If so, it loses the Fallproof feature and all forms of knockback and falling damage against the misai are increased by half again. Furthermore, the distance the misai travels when knocked back is increased by half again.
