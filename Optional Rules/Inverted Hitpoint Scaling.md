A character's hitpoints, whilst at level 1, are treated as though they were lavel 10. Each time they gain a new level, their effective level for the purpose of determining their maximum hitpoints is reduced by 1.

###### This represents a character aging and leaving their prime as they continue, while their gained class features represent accrued knowledge, wisdom, and technique as they gain more experience.
