All firearms have a mechanism by which they are operated that can affect how exactly they are handled. These are the Looselock, Matchlock, Sliverlock, Sparklock, and Wyrdlock.

##### Looselock
This firearm has no specific physical mechanism for firing. Instead, it has a small hole at the base of the barrel (usually at the top) where a lit fuse is placed. When the fuse burns to the end, it lights the powder. This mechanism is obsolete. Any attack made with this is delayed based on the fuse (which can be measured in phases or rounds) and suffers a -1 to the attack which is doubled if not aimed and/or rested against another object (or over the shoulder as below). The benefits of this mechaninsm is that the fuse could be cut to a specific desired duration and the attack no longer is treated as an action (though using the match is). Additionally, all guns fired this way may be used over the shoulder to halve the recoil by making oneself prone until the end of the round it is fired.  
Wet environments make it difficult to ensure a proper firing. There is a 1 in 20 chance of a misfire. A misfire is equally likely to be a delayed shot, a netutralized shot (the powder doesn't catch), or an explosion- ruining the weapon.  
No change in price of the weapon.

##### Matchlock
A matchlock firearm has a flash pan on the side above the trigger/lever of the weapon which contains a small amount of powder (not included in the powder of the bullet). This powder is then ignited by a match (either mechanically or by hand) to fire the weapon.  
Like with the looselock, this is difficult to use in a damp environemnt or the rain. There is no change in price of the firearm for this mechanism.

##### Sliverlock
A fine hole is drilled into the body of the firearm which ends in a chamber at the base of the barrel. When a tinder sliver (as per the adventuring item) is jammed into the hole, it ignites the powder in the barrel to fire. The tinder sliver is consumed in the process. One should remember to shake out the remains of the tinder sliver after firing to ensure it is cleared for the next to prevent misfires. Easier to use in damp environments than looselock and matchlock firearms.  
The price of this is an additional $45.

##### Sparklock
With this mechanism, a piece of flint (or similar material) is held in a clamp which is hammered against a hardened piece of curved metal which will express sparks. Some of these sparks will enter the chamber at the base of the barrel to ignite the powder. Easier than the looselock and the matchlock, though not as reliable in moist environments as a sliverlock, it boasts not requiring any additional components to fire so long as the flint is still good.  
Triples the price of the firearm.

##### Wyrdlock
An expense firearm which is essentially powered by a wand inside the weapon. This increases the price by 750%. Additionally, _there is a 1 in 20 chance that weapon explodes if used in the proximity of magic_.

###### With the wyrdlock, this begs the question- why not simply have a gun that doesn't need powder? The in world reasoning is that the combustion from the firewand-esque mechanisms doesn't produce the same kind of pressure to propel the bullet that powder does. The game design reason is to ensure that there is more variety in weapon types.
