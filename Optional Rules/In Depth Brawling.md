A brawl occurs when two hostile combatants come in physical contact with each other. To determine the effects of a brawl, the attacker and defender make an opposed [Body] check* and an opposed [Rflx]* check. A success with either check will force the opponent to forfeit their turn during the next action phase. Success with both will also force the opponent to forfeit their turn during the following action phase, presuming they are still brawling. A critical success will allow that participant to choose between the following options: Grapple, Shove, or Slam. A critical success with both opposed checks allows that participant to choose two options instead.
If both participants have a critical success, no one chooses an option.
A unit involved in a brawl cannot sprint and has all forms of movement reduced by half.

*A character proficient in Wrestling adds their proficiency die to their checks.

###### This was the original rules for brawling, the idea being that you could determine results for a whole round worth of brawling immediately and that Body and Reflex should each be more impactful. This was changed to streamline it and make it less clunky.
