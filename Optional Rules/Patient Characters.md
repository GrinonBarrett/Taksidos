A player's character gains a +1 to attacks and defense against foes which act earlier in the turn order.

###### This can let players feel a bit better about bad initiative rolls and can also incentivize reacting against already active foes as opposed to ganging up on a foe yet to act. Not a rule I plan on using but it can be good for some groups (like all of these optional rules).
