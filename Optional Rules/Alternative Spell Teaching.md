### Teaching A Spell
It is posible, in the rare instances of chance, that one possessing the ability to cast a spell could teach another so long as they have a method to learn the spell. This requires an amount of time equal to 260 hours, times the minimum tier of the spell squared, divided by the greatest of either the teacher or student's [Magic] bonus. A player character may use their heroism in place of their [Magic] bonus for this purpose. A teacher may teach multiple students simultaneously (up to the highest tier they have successfully cast the spell + their [Magic] bonus), but the time required is determined for each.

If a student uses a completely different method of spellcasting than the teacher (for example, if one uses the Pact of Blood and another uses Wyrding), there is a 15% chance that each hour of training will not contribute to the learning.

###### These were technically the original rules for teaching spells, but I decided almost immediately after producing them how I wanted them to function.
