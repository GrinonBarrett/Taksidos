#### Dive for Cover
Reaction  
In response to potentially being affected by an effect which would affect an area, a character may dive for cover by immediately moving to a position which is within a jump's distance. If they do, they are prone and vulnerable until the end of the next round. They then perform a [Rflx] save to determine if they even avoid the effect. This cannot be done if already prone. The DV is 20.  
A narrator may opt to simply allow a character to dive this way when not avoiding an effect, but we recommend reserving this for those particular occasions.  
If the effect would be an attack roll, the DV is instead the attack roll result.

###### These were the original rules for diving, but I did not like them as time went on.
