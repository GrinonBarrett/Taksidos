Hitpoints no longer prevent incapcitation saves, but instead grant a bonus to the save equal to your remaining pool for the purpose of determining if it is a critical success. You gain the benefit of the hitpoint before it is lost.

###### Keeps every hit lethal, but still lets martial classes have a little bit of an edge in combat.
