When a creature performs a save, it rolls an additional die at the narrator's discretion, between a d4 and a d12.

###### As it currently stands, it is intended for player characters to be less susceptible to save-related effects to help show how outstanding they are and to also cut down on how likely the party is to have the game halt and fun ruined from a bad roll. It would be resonable to allow creatures a better chance too. This can lead to more direct-damage oriented tactics used all around.
