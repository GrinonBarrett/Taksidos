A narrator may choose to completely ignore standard DVs presented throughout this system. Alhough this is discouraged, there can be several valid reasons for this. Not the least of which would be a streamlined and consistant experience. In this case, the narrator may wish to assign a set DV based on how difficult they believe the check/save should be. This should not alter the difficulty of spellchecks.

| Difficulty | DV of check |
|------------|-------------|
| | |
| Easy       |     8       |
| Typical  | 12 |
| Challenging | 16 |
| Difficult | 19 |
| Extraordinarily Difficult | 23 |
| Legendarily Difficult | 27 |
| Near Impossible |    30  |
