A character does not get a hermorrhage but is instead blodied, causing the foloowing penalties:
 * -1 to all checks and attack rolls
 * -3 to all saves other than incapacitation saves
 * -5 to all incapacitation saves
The condition can still be treated as normal.

A narrator may also opt to apply this when a character loses multiple hitpoints in a round or has none remaining.

###### This will be simpler for many players, and reduces record keeping. It also makes it a little less brutal for characters engaged in longer encounters.
