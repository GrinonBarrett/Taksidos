For each size larger a creature is against the opponent, it gains a +1 bonus to its [Body] for the purpose of that brawl/trample. Conversely, each size smaller than an opponent grants a creature a +1 to their [Rflx] for this purpose as well.

###### This can add some nice flavor to brawling if using the In Depth Brawling optional rule, but almost any gain from the rule is also undone by it.
