For each size larger a creature is against the opponent, it gains a +1 bonus to its [Body] for the purpose of that brawl/trample. Conversely, each size smaller than an opponent grants a creature a +1 to their [Rflx] for this purpose as well.

###### This can add some nice flavor to brawling, but almost any gain from the rule is also undone by it. Were it not for that, I would have included it as a part of the rules.
