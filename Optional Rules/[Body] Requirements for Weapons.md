To use a melee weapon in one hand, the character must have a [Body] score which is triple the weight in pounds of the weapon. To use in two hands, it need only be double.  
A two handed weapon used with one hand this way has any attacks resolved after all other melee attacks and reactions cannot be made with the two handed weapon unless your [Body] is four times the weight in pounds of the weapon.

Any attack made by a creature which does not have sufficient [Body] suffers disadvantage.  

###### This both restricts characters with lower [Body] and gives greater [Body] characters more options.
