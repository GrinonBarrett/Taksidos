As an alternative to requiring a character with the burglary skill to undo locks, you can provide the following minigame. This can also be a wonderful way to add tension to lockpicking attempts made when characters are in combat. When doing so, each attempt at a pin (whether successful or not, wheterh it is a guess or adjustment, etc), counts as their action or movement during a single phase.

Each lock has 4 pins. Each pin is represented by a random number from 1-12. The on attempting the lockpicking must attempt to satisfy each pin's exact number.

When starting, the character rolls 3d6 and sets them aside. If they are proficient in burglary, they may roll 4d6 instead. This represents the number of points is their expertise pool. In sequential order, the picklocke (one undertaking the task), guesses a number between 1 and 12. If they get it right, they move on to the next pin. If the guess is wrong, they may roll a d12 and that result is (secretly) compared. If it is wrong, the narrator explains in which direction the target number is but not how far. The picklocke may then add/subtract from the die result by a number of points, reducing their expertise pool by an equal amount, to determine if the pin has been satisfied. 

If the picklocke has no more remaining points in their expertise pool and cannot continue, they may attempt a final guess at the pin. If it fails, their mechanical tools have been ruined.

This continues until all pins have been satisfied or the picklocke cannot continue. 

Any bonuses the picklocke would get to an appropriate check is instead a bonus to their expertise pool.
