A character can not learn an unlimited number of spells and must instead be limited to a number equal to their heroism. When they attempt to learn any spells beyond this, they simply choose a spell to "forget" once it is learned.

ALternatively, a narrator may deem the limit to be equal to the character's level.

Class and species features should not be included in these limits.

###### To limit the power (and potentially overlap) of magic users in a group, the narrator may want to limit the spellcasting capacity some as the hypothetically infinite capacity for different magics could make some longer gaming groups create characters that simply cannot be stumped due to their own arsenal of magics.
