### TENSION
Adventuring is stressful. It takes its toll physically, mentally, and emotionally. Anytime the character critically fails a check/save, fails a save against a fear-related effect, or is affected by a critical hit, they receive a point of tension. They may also receive a point of tension for each day beyond the first without rest. Once their tension equal or exceeds their level, they are subject to the Oramous condition.  

If a character's gains a point of tension while already having twice as much as their level, they must perform an incapaitation save or die immediately.

A short rest can reduce tension by 1. A long rest can reduce your current amount by 1d4. A full rest can reduce it by 1d6+1d4.

With that comes the following condition, Oramous.

##### Oramous
An alternative spelling to a lithen word which has no direct translation, it refers to a sort of madness brough about by a mix of fear, mental and emotional disresonance, and phsyical stress. Adventurers which are subject to too much tension can be described as such. A creature which has become oramous is subject to the following:

• You lose your benefits of heroisim (that is, it is treated as +0).

• You have disadvantage on all saves against fear.

• You have disadvantage on incapacitation saves.

• When you take this condition, choose either Dazed or Vulnerable. You have the chosen condition until your tension is reduced to 0.

• This condition is lost when your tension returns to 0.
