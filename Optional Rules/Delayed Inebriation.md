Each point of inebriation can last for 1d12 + 1d8 minutes. This is individual to each point of inebriation. When the time expires from the inebriation point, each die is reduced by 1 level each. Once a die is reduced below 1, it is no longer rolled. When both dice are lost from the inebriation, that point of inebriation is lost.  
A point of inebriation does not begin for a number of minutes equal to your [Fort] bonus + 1.

When your inebriation reachs half of your [Fort] score, you are obtunded. When your inebriation is 3/4 of your [Fort] score, you are stuporous. When your inebriation reaches your [Fort] score, you are incapacitated.

###### These are the original rules for inebriation, but not everyone wants all that time keeping.
