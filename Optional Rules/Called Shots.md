A character may attempt to have their attack pointed against a specific point of a foe, choosing a specific wound result before rolling the attack. The attack receives a -5 penalty. If the wound result, after any modifications, is within 8 steps of the intended result, it becomes the result.

Alternatively, a narrator may want to make it a -3 penalty with a range of 5 steps from the intended result.

The penalty should be ignored for the purpose of determining a critical hit.
