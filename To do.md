For this update:

* Finish Languages.
* Create a serpentine ooze creature.
* Add Ashellen, a powder for washing gear. Can be used for washing one's body parts but can cause damage to the skin if used more than rarely.
* Add a spell beginning with J
* Add a magic sword that turns slain creatures into a simple slime creature.

Next update:  
* Create 5 more lesser serviles (Slaporb, Teleporb, Emolga type creature, Ophideon, Bird of prey).
* Create 2 more greater serviles (One is a knight, and another is a clay golem like entity)
* Create dough type monster.
* Create the Wekowyrd, an Everforming Eldritch Horror capable of mutating or regenerating in battle. Doing so will force counterspell checks out to a great distance against anyone casting a spell. Its counterspell bonus is equal to its current HP and its current wounds. A possible mutation of it is to increase HP.
* Create a Knemui. Mucousy illusion casting goblins that cause mischief. They are usually invisible but can be seen through a variety of strange methods (Squirting lemon juice in your eyes, the light of a fire which is cooking food, chewing on a piece of birch bark, holding a hazelnut, covering yourself in lamp oil, holding your breath under water even if you can breath underwater, casting a spell known by the knemui, or being within magical light). They can be pacified by giving them a gift given to you in celebration of your bithday or a wedding, a fine piece of mechanical art, or inviting them to a feast set for them.
* Make some Kaiju type monsters.
* Will add Mothman?!
* Make a Tessarifterotoi, a four winged dragon like creature.
* Add a few real diseases.

Also, at some point soon, make the failed alchemical cycle:  
* Massaconfusar. A being composed of jet black solids linked by a thick smoke. It consumes matter.
* Ablutior. A vaporous white entity which affeccs those around it psychically.
* Citrinitar. An ooze of bright yellow which glows dimly. It can transmute metals. It is attracted to sources of magic, but is highly resistant to them. It is toxic to life.
* Rubedooze. A red liquid which consumes matter and can be shaped by the effects of magic.

Hydroform  
Caster becomes a liquid.

Telekinesis  
A means of moving objects like a sling, but more powerful depending on tier.

Wall of Denial  
A wall which can stop ranged missiles and attacks from spells if cast at half or lower tier. Can also potentially stop other magical effects from bypassing. If cast high enough, it can stop siege weapons.

Curation  
A creature you touch performs a [Fort] save for each disease which afflicts them, gaining a bonus for the spell's tier. A critical success will cure the creature of the disease regardless.

Temporalysis  
Makes time pass by 1d6+spell tier time units (minutes, hours, or days as caster desires) for the caster. Can potentially include extra members. Time passes around them but not for them. Additional tiers can modify the die level.


Create the Alchemy system in which potions and powders can be created with effect varying depending on their ingredients.

Expand the magical services. Expand services in general to include messengers, assassins, and scouts.

Possible traditional fantasy races to add:

* Nissen (singular Nisser). Fricken Gnomes.

Classes, Done:  
**A**canist  (Intelligence caster)  
**A**ssassin (Backstab)  
**B**ard (Informed folks with bonuses against certain creatures and spell types, does not add new spell casting method but does provide some protection against spells)  
**B**erserk (rage wielders)  
**C**leric  (preistly sort that uses ritual magic and prayer, uses [Empy] for casting)  
**E**voker  (ki blast pew pew) *although Super Techniques need to be developed*  
**M**agi (can use spell points to cast spells, uses Will for casting)  
**M**onk (has auras and can be either a martial artist or a support class. Will have an aura or two, but gains features based on monastic order.) *Could still use a few more orders*  
**P**aragon  (gives commands to allies)  
**R**ogue  (has some skill bonuses and luck. A customizable class.)  
**S**orcerer (A Fort based spellcaster who takes on exhaustion for increased spell casting and or spell power)  
**W**arrior  (Full blown fighter)  

Non-Canon Classes, Done:  
**I**nvoker  (Akin to how d2 handled summoning for Druid and Necromancer, a support class that brings their battle buddies. Good for solo adventures. Potentially able to break the game and bog down combat.)  
**J**ester  (a sort of buff and debuff support role that can use skills in new ways)  
**M**ystic  (Has a set of evolving powers from their patron, chooses casting attribute but has an altered feature based on this. Can "burn" attributes to boost spell checks.)  

###### Non-Canon classes are intended to be fully fleshed out and balanced classes, but many will not want them in their campaigns.

Possible classes to do:  
**?**?*?* (A class which can potentially induce tension upon itself and others as a result of their unorthodox or unnatural method of performing magic. Might instead make a species which does this or n alternative magic option for mystics)  
Ranger? (Lots of folks like the idea of the ranger but trying to balance it right could be tough, at least to balance it without stepping on the toes of other classess)
*?**?**?* (A class inspired by old martial arts movie choreography, which gets certain benefits while disadvantaged)

##### What is the difference between a playable species and a non-playable creature?
To be playable, the creature (or rather species) must meet the following criteria.  
* It must not be mindless.
* It must seem distinctive from other species.
* It must be able to be "somewhat balanced" compared to other species.
* Members of the species must be capable of being cognisent of the difference between instincts and morality and able to create and operate by morality systems other than its own innate instincts.
