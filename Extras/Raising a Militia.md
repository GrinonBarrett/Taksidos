It is possible that the player characters may opt to raise a small force of their own to engage in conflicts or be ready to present against an unknown force.

All peasents are considered incompetent with weapons. This means they can use them, but have disadvantage on attack rolls, parries, and beats with the weapon. Their ranges with ranged weapons are also halved. Once a peasent has spent enough time training, they are considered competent and no lnger suffer the associated penalties with the weapon. Further training could be achieved but will yield diminishing returns. The trainer must have the associated training with the weapon, and an additional training level with said weapon, in question and must be present for all training time. The training time for a peasent to achieve proficiency is 9 times as much as the minimum hours. A peasant attempting to achieve specialization would require 20 time the minimum hours. A peasant attempting to achieve expertise would require 60 times the minimum hours.

A trainer may only train a number of peasents equal to 12 + their level at a time. A warrior may also train an additional number of peasents to acquire competency equal to their heroism.

Each day of training can be as little as 3 hours or as much as 10 hours. After a whole year, a peasant's total effective training time is halved, making it important to keep conscripts well trained.
