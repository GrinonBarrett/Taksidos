#### Oldcastle
A common board game played in the west. It is said to be the game of sieges.

##### Setup
The game is played on a board with marked spaces linked by direct lines (see the board image). The pieces are each cubes with 3 pairs of facings. One pair is swords, one pair is shields, the other pair is blank. Each player puts their pieces on the begnning spaces (as indicated by the board image).

##### Basics
Each player will take turns moving a piece to an unocciped adjacent piece. The game ends if a player runs out of pieces (they lose), cannot perform a legal move (they lose), or the swords player their pieces occupy the "keep" space or both "rook" spaces (swords player wins). If a piece is adjacent to an opposing piece, and there is an unocciped space adjacent to that opposing piece- the player may "jump" that piece as the action for their turn. This cannot be done if the jumping piece would move into a space it is already adjacent to.  
A piece can never enter a occupied space by the other player's piece.

##### Other Rules
If an opposing piece is completely surrounded by their pieces, they may instead make that opposing piece blanck as their action. If a player's piece is adjacent to a blank piece, they may convert it to one of their own pieces as their action for the turn. If a blank piece is completely surrounded by a player's pieces, they may opt to remove that piece from the board.

##### Variants
* In some circles, a piece which is adacent to more pieces than an opposing piece trying to jump cannot be taken.
* In some circles, you may jump blank pieces. Whether or not it is removed from the board also vearies from region to region.
* In the Meolasine empire, this rules is popular but the would be "jumper" can still be moved as though it jumped that piece.
* In a Lithen variant, the rooks are replaced with 2 "camps", which is the rear most pair on the swords' side. If the shields can occupy both camps while he swords do not hold the keep, the shield player wins. Additionally, in place of potentially jumping a blank piece, you may remove it from the board and move the would-be jumper into the space that blank piece previously occupied. You cannot jump blank pieces in this style of Oldcastle.
