A common card game in the meolasine empire. Played with a deck of cards. The goal is to have the most sets of cards when the deck runs out. The deck has three suits, shields (brown), leaves (green), and swords (black). Points required to make a set is the number of players plus your current number of baskets. Sets must be made of 3 cards exactly. A crown is worth any amount, including nothing. A player that makes sets with all three crowns automatically wins. If a player ever has all three in hand when the game starts must reveal them and becomes the dealer for the next game. Some gambling houses let them take half of the opening (betting) pot upon doing so instead. If there is ever a tie, the player with the most sets involving a crown wins.

At game start, deck is shuffled and four cards are dealt to each player. Each player takes a turn either putting a set down, drawing a card, or trading a public card. A player can have no more than 6 cards inhand, with extra cards being returned to the deck to be shuffled. A player may set one of their cards face up in front of them, so long as no other such card is there, at the end of their turn (before returning any excess cards to the deck). A player may use their face up (or "public") card for making any sets. In place of drawing a card, another player may swap a card from their hand with another player's public card.
