Almost as useful as magic armor, depending on who you ask.

**Abyscaun**, $6,800, 25 lbs. (*unique*)  
+2  
A shield made up of a complete manfolk skeleton and some ultrahard mud. There is damage to various bones, with some looking suspiciously fresh. The name "Abyscaun" is carved into the head. Requires 15 or greater [Body] to use. When used to block for yourself, you are also treated as having an additional quarter of coverage. *When stood upon solid ground and its name uttered, it will begin to collapse and then assemble itself into an Animate Skeleton. This skeleton will follow the command of the one who planted it. If destroyed in this form (or given a command to simply collapse) it is no longer active. If left overnight, it will somehow return to its shield form. Each time it is destroyed in its animated form, roll a d20 and compare it to the number of times it has been destroyed, if lower, it no longer reassembles itself in any capacity and the shield is considered to be fully destroyed. It has already fallen 1d4 times this way when found*.

**Battered Ward**, $3,150 , 12 lbs. (*unique*)  
+0  
Intended to provide as much cover from missiles as possible while also being practical in a melee, the tower shield is famously used in formation where its cover can be maximized.
Requires 13 or greater [Body] to use. Does not provide a set bonus when blocking, instead it provides cover. If the shield is used to block for someone that does not have cover, it provides half cover. If they already have cover, it instead provides an additional one-quarter cover.
When used to block for yourself, it is always treated as giving you an additional quarter of coverage.  
*When used to block for someone else, it also grants a bonus to defense equal to the lowest of either your [Empy] bonus or theirs. If an attack you attempt to block would qualify to damage armor, it instead destroys this shield*.

**Bellowing Buckler**, $1,000 , 2.25 lb.  
+1  
This well hammered buckler is nothing too extraordinary at first glance. It does not provide the passive protection against ranged attacks. It can also be used to turn your unarmed attack into a weapon attack. It still inflicts a bare attack this way. *If used to block an attack, and that attack is a critical failure or would qualify to damage armor, the buckler is struck- causing it to resonate in a way that inflicts a Sonic attack against that foe if within 3 yards*.

**Enchanted Shield**, varies, varies,  
Varies  
An enchanted shield costs 4 times the base price and an additional $2,000. Depending on the type of enchantment, your bonus to defense/cover for blocking against a certain type of attack is doubled. The Enchantments are as follows:  
* Insoluble: Acid.
* Ridged: Biting.
* Warm: Cold.
* Stalwart: Crushing.

**Kalarafyrd's Bulwark**, $1,100 , 13 lb. (*unique*)  
+0  
Requires 13 or greater [Body] to use. Does not provide a set bonus when blocking, instead it provides cover. If the shield is used to block for someone that does not have cover, it provides half cover. If they already have cover, it instead provides an additional one-quarter cover.
When used to block for yourself, it is always treated as giving you an additional quarter of coverage.  
*If an attack against you would qualify to deal damage, you may have this shield break instead. If you do, it becomes a normal buckler and you recover a hitpoint if you have any missing*.

**Fanijin's Guard**, $1,200, 4 lb. (*unique*)  
+1  
A finely made rondache stained by wode and adorned with altyprium. *The wearer gains an additional +1 to defense against magical attacks. If a magical attack is blocked, and that attack is a critical failure, the wearer may reduce their spell sickness by 1*.   

**Moor Ranger's Favor**, $350 , 3.75 lb.  
+1  
A simple cheap wood shield with a thin tanned covering. It is not a common sight and is often a simple targe which has been blessed or otherwise enchanted. *If used to block a magical attack, and that attack is a critical hit or would qualify to damage armor- it instead destroys the shield. If it would have wounded the wearer, it still does so*.

**Radiant Bastion**, $1,200 , 6 lb.  
+3  
An ornate kite shield wielded by the most holy of warriors. If the wearer is afflicted by a necrotic attack *they may treat their next attack as being radiant*. They also gain a *+1 bonus to defense against necrotic and radiant attacks*.

**Soul PLate**, $1,200 , 2.5 lb.  
+1  
A small style of shield with a polished silver boss. It does not provide the passive protection against ranged attacks. It can also be used to turn your unarmed attack into a weapon attack. It still inflicts a bare attack this way. *It provides an additional +3 to blocking magical attacks*.

**Tainted Targe**, $900, 3.5 lb.  
+1  
A small shield belonging to a forgotten adventurer. When the user inflicts a critical hit with a weapon or unarmed attack, *the user may treat it as toxic or necrotic*.   

**Umarion**, $1,480 , 8 lb. (*unique*)  
+2  
A pale blue colored kite shield. *If name is known, the bonus for blocking is increased by 1. This is increased by an additional 1 against magical attacks*.
