Here are listed various deities of each pantheon.

###### Please forgive as this one will take time to move from one section of notes.

## Meolasine
Meolasine deities are shared with outside cultures and are not exactly a trademark of the meolasine culture. Likewise, deities of other cultures may also see some tributes from the meolas peoples. This pantheon represents the core of deities which the state supports publicly.

#### Othmazdo
A god of life, death, and vengeance. He is one of the the quadrons of the afterlife. He is a common patron for members of the military class.

#### Tamas
A god of death, law, and community. He is one of the quadrons of the afterlife. His role is to ensure that righteous rulers (and even leaders of a lesser position) have a comfortable afterlife and that inscrupulous rulers suffer until dark of a night devoid of drawn breath. He is a common patron for aristocrats and clergy.

## Lithenic
The exact origin of Lithenic deities is heavily debated. Some argue that they are actually stolen from lessor known pantheons belonging to now forgotten peoples. Others claim they are actually exaggerations of historical characters. Regardless, if one is to communicate within the lithen communities, they should be learned of the pantheon to make sense of many of its expressions. In Lithenic theology, children are considered to be expressions of more minute forms of the parent's symbol. Thus the children of Zerun, when referred to as such, are functionally narrowed aspects of Zerun himself.

#### Aqazos
The serpent that marks the barrier of this realm for those beyond. Both ends of its body terminates in a head. It watches over the natural world. It is also a messenger for the gods beyond our realms, where each head may communicate independently. Aqazos is noted as the least emotional, yet no less furious, of the gods.

#### Azerion
Guardian of the island of the river of the afterlife, where souls may land before going a drift towards their final destination. He is a skeletal figure with the skull of something between a man and a bull. If one chose to break a vow to a god or defile their sacrifice to their god in some way (such as fraud of desecration) he will lock them in his cavern labyrinth to chase down as food later.
Sometimes, those in the mortal world that get lost in caves will find themselves in his labyrinth. He has been known to come out of such caves to seek out one who has profaned a divine sacrificial offering to eat them.

#### Iozt
A patron of intellectuals and son of Wothin, Iozt is often portayed as a trickster and sometimes antagonist of the story, yet is just as frequently by the sides of the fellow gods in tales. It is said that he is to be the example of how the most logical thought is not always the most popular or first thought of one's mind.

#### Taiyanamas
Son of Zerun, he is the embodiment of athleticism.

#### Ulcin
Smith of the gods, he is responsible for the creation of many items. He does not enjoy the company of most outside of hosted events. He usually only occurs in a story to create something that aids the main character of the story.

#### Wothin
Father of Zerun, among others, he is the passionate and charismatic father. His domain is knowledge and leadership, along with misery and burden.

#### Xif
The patron of soft femeninity and wife to Zerun. She is the the goddess of maternity, understaning, and teaching. She is also know as the beautiful goddess.

#### Xrea
The patron of hard femininity. She is a source of magic, a passionate warrior, and a tender lover. She is also known as the lonely goddess.

#### Zaimosea
Daughter of Zerun. She is the one who reacts honestly and with full emotion.

#### Zerun
A god of protection, strength of character, forewardness, simple action, violence, lightning, and fury. Zerun's symbol is either an axe or a hammer depending on who you ask.
