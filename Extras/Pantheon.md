Here are listed various deities of each pantheon.

###### Please forgive as this one will take time to move from one section of notes.

## Meolasine
Meolasine deities are shared with outside cultures and are not exactly a trademark of the meolasine culture. Likewise, deities of other cultures may also see some tributes from the meolas peoples. This pantheon represents the core of deities which the state supports publicly.

#### Akhrer
A god of death, fermentation, and knowledge. A quadron of death and the patron deity of alchemists. Akhrer is also worshiped by makers of win, beer, and any distillate. It is said the Akhrer onced walked the lands making substances from whatever he could find and sharing it with the people. This brought beer, wine, spirits, and even alchemy to all- but also cursed us with poisons and death in the process. AS punishment, akhrer's role became that of an observant guide. He is not an uncommon alernative patron for clergy.

#### Breretha
Goddess of life and harvest. She draws in each seed a plan for its growth that it may thrive just as intended. It is said that if one of your seeds grows into a different plant than expected, she has a plan for it. Some small temples have been errected at the sites of such plants and their attendants can be quite hospitable to adventurers. The most common of patron deities in the meolasine pantheon.

#### Imuria
Sower of clouds and warden against evil. She sows clouds into the very tapestry  of the sky that the might unfurl where needed. SHe made Zyclode's shield and set him about on his mission to ensure the rrains. Interestingly, the Korventennain have a similar goddess in their pantheon.

#### Othmazdo
A god of life, death, and vengeance. He is one of the quadrons of the afterlife. He is a common patron for members of the military class.

#### Peluz
God of the sun and moon, he presides over light itself. He also functions as a messenger between gods and mortals. he is a common alternative patron to Tamas for aristocrats.

#### Tamas
A god of death, law, and community. He is one of the quadrons of the afterlife. His role is to ensure that righteous rulers (and even leaders of a lesser position) have a comfortable afterlife and that inscrupulous rulers suffer until dark of a night devoid of drawn breath. He is a common patron for aristocrats and clergy.

#### Thazduras
A god of death, mining, and wealth. He is the quadron of death banished to the depths of the earth. He loves fine craftsmanship and appreciates bold and skillful adventurers, but is said to punish greedy adventurers. His punishments were said to get so out of hand that he was not allowed overland unless it was to attend a funeral- an exception allowed since his favorite hero had been felled. It is said that he will show up to the funeral of a great person and donate large sums of money to their laying to rest. If someone touches this wealth though, he may be allowed to seek vengeance on the graverobbers.

#### Zyclod
A god of war, leadership, and adventurers. Zyclod leads heroes and gods alike to action. His javelin is the lightning in the storm and his shield, made of silver clouds, crashes with thunder when struck. Every storm is zyclod in battle. His most important duty is to do battle with creatures that withhold the rain in clouds, so that the soil may be nourished.

## Lithenic
The exact origin of Lithenic deities is heavily debated. Some argue that they are actually stolen from lessor known pantheons belonging to now forgotten peoples. Others claim they are actually exaggerations of historical characters. Regardless, if one is to communicate within the lithen communities, they should be learned of the pantheon to make sense of many of its expressions. In Lithenic theology, children are considered to be expressions of more minute forms of the parent's symbol. Thus the children of Zerun, when referred to as such, are functionally narrowed aspects of Zerun himself.

#### Aqazos
The serpent that marks the barrier of this realm for those beyond. Both ends of its body terminates in a head. It watches over the natural world. It is also a messenger for the gods beyond our realms, where each head may communicate independently. Aqazos is noted as the least emotional, yet no less furious, of the gods.

#### Azerion
Guardian of the island of the river of the afterlife, where souls may land before going a drift towards their final destination. He is a skeletal figure with the skull of something between a man and a bull. If one chose to break a vow to a god or defile their sacrifice to their god in some way (such as fraud of desecration) he will lock them in his cavern labyrinth to chase down as food later.
Sometimes, those in the mortal world that get lost in caves will find themselves in his labyrinth. He has been known to come out of such caves to seek out one who has profaned a divine sacrificial offering to eat them.

#### Iozt
A patron of intellectuals and son of Wothin, Iozt is often portayed as a trickster and sometimes antagonist of the story, yet is just as frequently by the sides of the fellow gods in tales. It is said that he is to be the example of how the most logical thought is not always the most popular or first thought of one's mind.

#### Taiyanamas
Son of Zerun, he is the embodiment of athleticism.

#### Ulcin
Smith of the gods, he is responsible for the creation of many items. He does not enjoy the company of most outside of hosted events. He usually only occurs in a story to create something that aids the main character of the story.

#### Wothin
Father of Zerun, among others, he is the passionate and charismatic father. His domain is knowledge and leadership, along with misery and burden.

#### Xif
The patron of soft femeninity and wife to Zerun. She is the the goddess of maternity, understaning, and teaching. She is also know as the beautiful goddess.

#### Xrea
