As an action, you may dismiss it- causing it to flee and dematerializing after some distance. While dismissed, it is considered to be resting.

Unique.  
Neg.  
A glass sphere no more than 3 inches in diameter, hand blown, with a small hoop handle which allows it to be worn as a necklace. *The wearer gains a +1 bonus to all [Prcp] checks and saves involving vision.

This causes it to expand in size, becoming a Sferakoz which is psychically linked to the wearer. It follows the wearer's command. If the sferakoz is destroyed, the bauble shatters. The wearer may spend a whole round in phsyical contact with the sferakoz to shrink it back down into its bauble form. While in its bauble form, the sferakoz is considered to be resting. If it rests for a whole week, it can benefit from an additional full rest for every whole week it is inactive.

If an attack would qualify to damage the wearer's armor while the cloak is active- the cloack is made useless and the effect ends. If the wear is ever afflicted by magical darkness, a radiant attack, or spell sickness- the effect wears off immediately. Additionally, once used, it must be bathed in fair or bright light for att least as long as the effect ;asted before it can be used again*.

To the human eye, the flame is normally a yellow-orange but will shift to a red color. Other eyes may see the color change differently, but will certainly notice it. So long as it is not in any area which supresses magic, it provides dim light out 15 yards. Otherwise,* it functions as a standard lantern. Regardless, it consumes oil at the same rate as a lantern.
