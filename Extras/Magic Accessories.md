**False Torch**, $20,000  
Unique  
Neg.  
A silver ring with a small pink topaz nested in its clutch.  
*The caster may cast the Faux Fos spell as though they knew it. The light put out from this Faux Fos is a neon pink. If the wearer already knew the spell, their casting time is reduced by 1 action*.

**The Iron Band**, $75,000  
Unique
Neg.
A ring of iron. If first worn while wearing armor, it doesn't seem to do anything. If worn without armor, it provides the effects of the Ironside spell with the following exceptions.  
* *Weight*. The creature's weight is increased by 1/3.
* *Thermal Resistance*. The form of Ironside provided by this ring does not grant Advantage/Disadvantage to fire or cold attacks against the wearer.
* *Weight Capacity*. The wearer's weight load limits are increased by half at each level.
* *Conductivity*. Electric attacks against the user have advantage.
* *Appearance*. The wearer does not seem visibly affected by the spell.
* If the spell Ironside would be cast on the wearer from another source while wearing the ring, it overides the effects of the ring's spell while the new spell lasts. Additionally, the ring cannot be removed during this time.

A creature which has worn the ring to benefit finds the rust has stained their skin permanently. They will also appear to bear harmless patches of rust when affected by an Ironside spell from other sources.

**Ring of Wondernaming**, $9,500  
Neg.  
A ring of modest quality. Not too gaudy, but not so plain.  
*The wearer knows when a spell is being cast by someone within their perceptions, and will know the name of that spell*.
