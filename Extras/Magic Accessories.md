**The Iron Band**, $75,000

* *Weight*. The creature's weight is increased by 1/3.
* *Thermal Resistance*. The form of Ironside provided by this ring does not grant Advantage/Disadvantage to fire or cold attacks against the wearer.
* *Weight Capacity*. The wearer's weight load limits are increased by half at each level.
* *Conductivity*. Electric attacks against the user have advantage.
* *Appearance*. The wearer does not seem visibly affected by the spell.
* If the spell Ironside would be cast on the wearer from another source while wearing the ring, it overides the effects of the ring's spell while the new spell lasts. Additionally, the ring cannot be removed during this time.

A creature which has worn the ring to benefit finds the rust has stained their skin permanently. They will also appear to bear harmless patches of rust when affected by an Ironside spell from other sources.
