Grimoires are tomes filled with the details of magical processes. Each tome contains 3-5 spells and can provide a +1 bonus to spellchecks with (and +1 to saves against) the spells contained therein if one already is knowledgeable in the spell, exactly like the bonus for staves (any feature which pertains to that bonus pertains to this as well). Additionally, if wielded in two hands, it can be studied by one capable of casting spells to cast a spell contained within even if the caster does not know it- but this requires twice as much casting time and foes not allow the spell to be cast beyond the tier it is recorded as within the grimoire.

A grimoire is sufficient material to study in learning a spell. Each spell is recorded with a set tier, which must be at least the minimum tier of the spell. This affects the learning time of the spell (some arcanists have been known to express more advanced versions of their spells, being those of a higher tier than minimum, specifically to keep inexperienced studiers from fully understanding them). The grimoire may include spells at a tier higher than their minimum. If they do, and one learns the spell from the grimoire, they may cast it at its minimum tier or higher as they would be able to had they earned any other way.

If a tome is written in a language the reader does not understand, they may require a check to understand the nature of any spell contained. A character capable of casting a spell can identify if the grimoire possesses it, but still cannot benefit from the tome until they can understand the written language.

#### Creating a Grimoire
The materials to create a grimoire sturdy enough to be reliable for one to learn from costs at least $1,000 per spell to be contained. Additionally, great care must be taken to ensure the material is suitable for any mage other than themself to understand as most mages have a distinctive style. This requires an amount of time equal to 336 hours, times the minimum tier of the spell squared, divided by the highest tier they have cast the spell as. An author may increase the tier that the spell is recorded as in their grimoire by an amount up to their [Inte] bonus without affecting the time to produce the manual. The weight of such an item is 1 pound plus half a pound per spell, with a minimum of 2 pounds.
