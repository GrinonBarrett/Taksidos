Special Features

**Innate Magical Power**: You learn a spell of your choice with a minimum tier of exactly 1. Additionally, you have a pool of 2 points of energy which may be used to grant a +1d2 bonus to a spell check or counter-spell check. You recover 1 such point on a long rest and all consumed points with a full rest.
At 7th level, this pool is increased by 1.

**Undead Nature**: Perdrine are reanimated dead, which grants them a few advantages.  
 • Perdrine do not need to eat, sleep or breath. They do still need to relax to rest.  
 • You are not affected by disease, poison, or venom. Effects which deal toxic damage do not affect you.  
 • You are immune to bloodloss.  
 • All forms of healing which would affect you have a 2 in 3 chance not to.  
 • You do not suffer effects of wounds. You do still receive wounds as a normal character though.

**Limited Form**: Perdrine have no limbs. They may only hold something with their mouth, allowing it to function as a hand without fine motor skills.  
Additionally, they cannot use any form of gear (including armor and weapons) which would require fine manipulation. Attack rolls made with weapons are made with disadvantage.

**Weak**: Your weight capacity is reduced by ½ at all load levels.

**Immunities**: The unique nature of a perdrine grants them several immunities as follows-  
 • Magic which affects flesh cannot affect you in any way.  
 • You are also immune to damage and other effects from unarmed attacks.  
 • Unarmed and weapon attacks against you cannot be a critical hit.

**Difficult to Hit**: Your defense is equal to your Heroism + your [Body] bonus. If you sprint, it is increased by your [Rflx] bonus until the end of the round. You may only benefit from [Rflx] this way once per round.

**Voidtouched**: You have seen the veil and, as a result, find yourself numb to the fears of mortality. Unless specified otherwise, fear based effects cannot affect you.

**Already Dead**: You cannot be instantly killed by magic unless it specifies otherwise. A wound you receive from Necrotic sources cannot kill you, even if you fail your incapacitation save.

**Locate Dead**: You may, at will, choose to know the precise location of every dead creature within a number of yards equal to triple your level. You can detect a dead creature so long as it would have some recognizable remains within range (even if you cannot normally perceive them). When you do so, you also know whether or not there is any undead creatures (other than yourself) within range (but not their exact location, number, or nature). You must rest before doing so again.

**Perdrine Power**: Every perdrine’s creation bestows it with one of a number of powers. Select one of the Perdrine Powers listed at the end of this block. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed.

**Ungrateful Dead**: You have such resentment for your state that it has actually affected the nature of the magic animating you.    
 • Anytime an undead creature attacks you, you may roll a d8 and add it your defense.  
 • When you use your Locate Dead feature, you can tell if there is a single undead creature or multiple.  
 • You may use your Locate Dead feature twice between rests.  
 • When an attack against you is a critical failure, you may move up to 1 yard.

### Ki
You have access to a pool of ki points which may be spent to activate certain features. This maximum number of ki points is the number shown on the Evoker table. When you complete a short rest, if you are below half of your ki maximum, you recover a point of ki. When you complete a long rest, you recover half of your missing ki. When you complete a full rest, you regain all expent ki.  
Whenyou perform a counterspell check, you may add your [Body] bonus.

### Ki Blast
You are capable of producing a burst of energy which can be propelled at a foe using your ki, by spending a single ki point as an action. This is a ranged Ki attack. It has a total range extending a number of yards equal to your [Body] plus your [Will]. The optimal range is a minimum of 3 yards and a maximum number of yards equal to your [Body].

### Ki Step
You may spend at least 2 points of ki to instantly move up to a number of feet equal the ki spent -1 as a reaction. May only be done in response to your own movement, your own actions, or a foe's failed attack. Attacks made against you can stil be rolled.

### Super Techniques
You are capable of learning special techniques which harness your ki in more powerful ways. You may learn a total number of super techniques equal to your heroism.

### 2) Empowered Strikes
When you perform a melee attack, you may spend 2 points of ki to gain a +1 bonus to that attack. If it was not a wand or staff attack (except a staff being treated as a club), you may choose to have that attack become a ki attack.

### 2) Step Dash
Once per round as an action, if you performed a Ki Step during the previous phase, you may perform a movement.

### 3) Ki Blast Volley
When you use your action to fire a Ki Blast, you may fire any number of ki blasts by spending an amount of Ki equal to the attacks fired +1. Each attack may have the same or different target. Each attack against the same target gets a -1 penalty for each other ki blast targeted against them.

### 4) Empowered Slam
You may spend any amount of ki when you slam a foe to gain a bonus to your result equal to the ki spent this way.

### 4) Some Training
Choose an attribute. It is improved by 1. You gain training in a weapon of your choice.

### Arcane Study
You are able to perform intense calculations about the nature of magic. When you perform a spellcheck or a skill check involving the nature of magic you may spend an additional round without performing any actions to gain a bonus equal to your [Inte] bonus.  
Additionally, when you perform a spellcheck, you may choose to roll 2d8 instead of 1d20. If you do, you gain a bonus equal to your [Inte] bonus.  
Furthermore, when performing a counter-spell check, you may add your [Inte] bonus.

### Disruptive Strike
When you successfully perform a melee attack against a creature which is casting a spell or afflicted by Spell Sickness, it incurs a point of Spell Sickness.
