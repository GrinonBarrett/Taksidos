Without Spoiling anything here, party is a part of one of many groups sent from the east to acquire and escort a massive shipment of copper by their employer.

Their employer is Telmun of the Etradeces (A chain of large islands and coastal colonies).  
The copper seller is Dilmun of Thesterom ( a mountain valley near great lakes).

Party is to escort the proper 36,000 pounds of copper back. Travel from the beginning of the campaign will be 4 weeks. Travel after they get there and head back to the port will be 6 weeks. Sailing will be another 3 weeks.

Each member of the expedition gets one share of the total bounty. Accountants receive an additional share. Healers receive an additional share. Team leaders (like Wurgen) receive 2 additional shares.  
If the party does well, a team leader may opt to grant them each an additional share.  
The bounty is $198,000- but there are roughly 60 others involved in the operation (there are three teams of 20 adventurers which includes a leader, an accountant, and a healer. Approximately 72 shares plus the players.).
