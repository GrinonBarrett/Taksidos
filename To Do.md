Add more alternatively sized weapons

Finish ~~Horse~~ and Vehicle rules. ~~Maybe add a couple more mounts~~

Edit Character Creation  
In particular, finish up the classes and ~~species~~.

Classes, Done:  
**A**canist  (Intelligence caster)  
**A**ssassin (Backstab)  
**B**ard (Informed folks with bonuses against certain creatures and spell types, does not add new spell casting method but does provide some protection against spells)  
**B**erserk (rage wielders)  
**C**leric  (preistly sort that uses ritual magic and prayer, uses [Empy] for casting)  
**E**voker  (ki blast pew pew) *although Super Techniques need to be developed*  
**J**ester  (a sort of buff and debuff support role that can use skills in new ways)  
**M**agi (will have the spell point guessing system, uses Will for casting)  
**M**onk (has auras and can be either a martial artist or a support class. Will have an aura or two, but gains features based on monastic order.) *Could still use a few more orders*  
**P**aragon  (gives commands to allies)  
**R**ogue  (has some skill bonuses and luck)  
**S**orcerer (A Fort based spellcaster who takes on exhaustion for increased spell casting and or spell power)  
**W**arrior  (Full blown fighter)  

Possible classes to do:  
**I**nvoker?  (Akin to how d2 handled summoning for Druid and Necromancer, a support class that brings their battle buddies)  
**W**arlock?  (Has a set of evolving powers from their patron, chooses casting attribute but has an altered feature based on this)  
**?**?*?* (A class which can potentially induce tension upon itself and others as a result of their unorthodox or unnatural method of performing magic. Might instead make a species which does this)

###### May ditch the warlock as something similar in terms of flavor and mechanics can be done with monk and or cleric.

Contemplate renaming Rogue to Venturer.

Contemplate renaming Clerics to Mystics.

Finish serviles.

Flesh out bestiary.

MORE SPELLS!

Create the Alchemy system in which potions and powders can be created with effect varying depending on their ingredients.

Expand the magical services. Expand services in general to include messengers, assassins, and scouts.

###### May split the spells into their own repository and the creatures into their own. This would make it a touch easier to fork for folks to do some homebrew with down the road.
