Add more alternatively sized weapons

Finish ~~Horse~~ and Vehicle rules. ~~Maybe add a couple more mounts~~

Edit Character Creation  
In particular, finish up the classes and ~~species~~.

Classes, Done:  
**A**canist  (Intelligence caster)  
**A**ssassin (Backstab)  
**B**ard (Informed folks with bonuses against certain creatures and spell types, does not add new spell casting method but does provide some protection against spells)  
**B**erserk (rage wielders)  
**C**leric  (preistly sort that uses ritual magic and prayer, uses [Empy] for casting)  
**E**voker  (ki blast pew pew) *although Super Techniques need to be developed*  
**M**agi (can use spell points to cast spells, uses Will for casting)  
**M**onk (has auras and can be either a martial artist or a support class. Will have an aura or two, but gains features based on monastic order.) *Could still use a few more orders*  
**P**aragon  (gives commands to allies)  
**R**ogue  (has some skill bonuses and luck. A customizable class.)  
**S**orcerer (A Fort based spellcaster who takes on exhaustion for increased spell casting and or spell power)  
**W**arrior  (Full blown fighter)  

Non-Canon Classes, Done:  
**I**nvoker?  (Akin to how d2 handled summoning for Druid and Necromancer, a support class that brings their battle buddies)  
**J**ester  (a sort of buff and debuff support role that can use skills in new ways)  

###### Non-Canon classes are intended to be fully fleshed out and balanced classes, but many will not want them in their campaigns.

Possible classes to do:  
**W**arlock?  (Has a set of evolving powers from their patron, chooses casting attribute but has an altered feature based on this)  
**?**?*?* (A class which can potentially induce tension upon itself and others as a result of their unorthodox or unnatural method of performing magic. Might instead make a species which does this)  
Ranger? (Lots of folks like the idea of the ranger but trying to balance it right could be tough, at least to balance it without stepping on the toes of other classess)

Contemplate renaming Rogue to Venturer.

Contemplate renaming Clerics to Mystics.

Finish serviles.

Flesh out bestiary.

MORE SPELLS!  
Havery? (makes one talk nonsensically)  
Heeze (toss the target into the air at a speed you determine)  
Jander (makes sick and visibly unappealing)  
Jolling (slows a creature's run speed by hindering limbs)

Create the Alchemy system in which potions and powders can be created with effect varying depending on their ingredients.

Expand the magical services. Expand services in general to include messengers, assassins, and scouts.

###### May split the spells into their own repository and the creatures into their own. This would make it a touch easier to fork for folks to do some homebrew with down the road.

Possible traditional fantasy races to add:  
Zwergain (singular is Zwergar). Dwarves.  
Aosith (singular is Aoseigh). A type of elf which is used to life distant from other races, they are adept in woods and caverns.  
Alderolves (singular is alderalv). A dark elf that lingers in the woods. Their woodland domain is a gateway to a dark bog-forest world. May simply make this a creature instead.  
Vilaves (singular Vilalf). A type of elf.  
Hulderveis (Singular Huldralf). A type of elf.  
Nissen (singular Nisser). Fricken Gnomes.
