Edit Character Creation  
In particular, finish up the classes and ~~species~~.  
Classes:  
~~**A**canist  (Intelligence caster)~~  
~~**A**ssassin (Backstab)~~  
~~**B**ard (Informed folks with bonuses against certain creatures and spell types, does not add new spell casting method but does provide some protection against spells)~~  
~~**B**erserk (rage wielders)~~  
**C**leric  (preistly sorts, uses [Empy] for casting)  
~~**E**voker  (ki blast pew pew)~~ *although Super Techniques need to be developed*  
~~**J**ester  (a sort of buff and debuff support role that can use skills in new ways)~~  
~~**M**agi (will have the spell point guessing system, uses Will for casting)~~  
~~**M**onk (has auras and can be either a martial artist or a support class. Will have an aura or two, but gains features based on monastic order.)~~ *Could still use a few more orders*  
~~**P**aragon  (gives commands to allies)~~  
~~**R**ogue  (has some skill bonuses and luck)~~  
~~**S**orcerer (A Fort based spellcaster who takes on exhaustion for increased spell casting and or spell power)~~  
**W**arlock?  (Has a set of evolving powers from their patron, chooses casting attribute but has an altered feature based on this)  
~~**W**arrior  (Full blown fighter)~~  

###### May ditch the warlock as something similar in terms of flavor and mechanics can be done with monk and or cleric (when it gets completed).

Also finish the optional summoning class (which needs a decent name) inspired by the way diablo 2 handled necro/druid summons. May alter the Bonding Magic of the invoker once the cleric is developed so that it no longer adds [Empy] to casting and counterspelling.

Create the Alchemy system in which potions and powders can be created with effect varying depending on their ingredients.

Expand the magical services. Expand services in general to include messengers, assassins, and scouts.
