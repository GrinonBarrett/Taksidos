For this update:
* Create Asterian as a playable species.
* Create Mystic class.
* Create ~~6~~ 4 more lesser serviles (Slaporb, Teleporb, Emolga type creature, Ophideon).
* Create 3 more greater serviles (One is a knight, another is a griffin, and another is a clay golem like entity)
* Finish combat test characters.
* Update Octo test character to reflect dagger change.
* Implement the multihand rewording suggested in the discord server.
* Give Perdrine a crystal skull option.
* Create a minotaur-esque legendary creature. He is undead. In a past life, he was a monstrous creature with a taste for human flesh. He now presides over his own new labyrynth where a god-like entity likes to send those that defile or make mockery of oferrings to the gods so he may chase them to exhaustion and eat them in a never ending cycle.
* Recreate the old Barmpasow creature for this system.
* Recreate the old Mountain Devil (dracnoic butrowing wyrms) for this system.
* Recreate the old Etermi creature for this system.
* Recreate the T Rex and Brachiosaurus creatures for this system.
* Create Chalcedon creature (Like pokemon's graveler but made of bnded gemstone. Acquires sustanance by tunneling into ore deposits).  
* Give the jester the ability to roll exotic attacks into a ball they can juggle. Rewuires a move, action, or reaction to maintain. Lasts for a minute. Can benefit from ant warrior mastery possessed. Can have up to their [Rflx] bonus +1 at a time. Make it a level 2 fearure and shift Japenup to level 6? Or maybe it should be level 6 and Jape left untouched.

-----
Add more alternatively sized weapons

Finish ~~Horse~~ and Vehicle rules. ~~Maybe add a couple more mounts~~

Create characters to test combat. Each character will have a level 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 variant to compare.
* Grisam, An axe and board user. Capable with a bow. Prefers maile armor.
* Midan, full blown sword swinging knight sort of warrior. Goes for greatsword with warpick for backup.
* Hallas, a wand focused warrior who can't really afford armor because wands ain't cheap.
* Miws, A yasani evoker which uses longsword.
* Zerocles, a yasani berserk who uses a sword and axe. High dex for dodging.
* Aghgleguglou, an oddu assassin who wields daggers.
* Forwyn, a polearm master warrior.
* , Crossbow wielding naghai rogue.
* , Etrid Berserk that focuses on unarmed attacks and katar.
* , A draconne evoker.
* , A pole axe focused assassin to see how busted we can make the pole axe criticals.

Contemplate renaming Rogue to Venturer.

Finish serviles.

Flesh out bestiary.

MORE SPELLS!  
Havery? (makes one talk nonsensically)  
Heeze (toss the target into the air at a speed you determine)  
Jander (makes sick and visibly unappealing)  
Jolling (slows a creature's run speed by hindering limbs)

Create the Alchemy system in which potions and powders can be created with effect varying depending on their ingredients.

Expand the magical services. Expand services in general to include messengers, assassins, and scouts.

###### May split the spells into their own repository and the creatures into their own. This would make it a touch easier to fork for folks to do some homebrew with down the road.

Classes, Done:  
**A**canist  (Intelligence caster)  
**A**ssassin (Backstab)  
**B**ard (Informed folks with bonuses against certain creatures and spell types, does not add new spell casting method but does provide some protection against spells)  
**B**erserk (rage wielders)  
**C**leric  (preistly sort that uses ritual magic and prayer, uses [Empy] for casting)  
**E**voker  (ki blast pew pew) *although Super Techniques need to be developed*  
**M**agi (can use spell points to cast spells, uses Will for casting)  
**M**onk (has auras and can be either a martial artist or a support class. Will have an aura or two, but gains features based on monastic order.) *Could still use a few more orders*  
**P**aragon  (gives commands to allies)  
**R**ogue  (has some skill bonuses and luck. A customizable class.)  
**S**orcerer (A Fort based spellcaster who takes on exhaustion for increased spell casting and or spell power)  
**W**arrior  (Full blown fighter)  

Non-Canon Classes, Done:  
**I**nvoker  (Akin to how d2 handled summoning for Druid and Necromancer, a support class that brings their battle buddies. Good for solo adventures. Potentially able to break the game and bog down combat.)  
**J**ester  (a sort of buff and debuff support role that can use skills in new ways)  

###### Non-Canon classes are intended to be fully fleshed out and balanced classes, but many will not want them in their campaigns.

Possible classes to do:  
**M**ystic  (Has a set of evolving powers from their patron, chooses casting attribute but has an altered feature based on this. Can "burn" attributes to boost spell checks.)  
**?**?*?* (A class which can potentially induce tension upon itself and others as a result of their unorthodox or unnatural method of performing magic. Might instead make a species which does this)  
Ranger? (Lots of folks like the idea of the ranger but trying to balance it right could be tough, at least to balance it without stepping on the toes of other classess)

Possible traditional fantasy races to add:  
* Alderolves (singular is alderalv). A dark elf that lingers in the woods. Their woodland domain is a gateway to a dark bog-forest world. May simply make this a creature instead.  
* Hulderveis (Singular Huldralf). A type of elf, the nymph-like beautiful and graceful sort.  
* Nissen (singular Nisser). Fricken Gnomes.
* Thursain (singular Thursar).  Giants which cause plague. Probably should be a creature instead.
