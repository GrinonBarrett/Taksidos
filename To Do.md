For this update:

* Create an Ajhas. A large squid like creature from the psychic plane. The tentacles end in eyballs. It breathes an acidic mist, to which its is immune, that it can use as a smokescreen. It floats and swims with a 12 yard speed and can interact with non-mindless creatures on the ethereal plane. Each eye can force a [Prcp] or [Rflx] save, foe's choice, or daze the creature. Has a -1 penalty to incap saves for each tentacle lost. Can swallow prey whole, melting it in its acid.
* Create a Lignafaguer. A six "legged" creature which feeds on wood. The legs are actually strikers it uses to strike creatures or climb. They are connected to a center body which possess a maw full of short razor sharp teeth. If grappling a foe, it can bits to deal biting cutting and acid attacks all at once. On the body between each legs are one of its six eyes. It does not eat meat or technically attack creatures, but anything disturbing its meal or the pursuit of it will be attacked.

For next update:

* Finish Languages.
* Create proper rules for contracting disease.
* Create 4 more lesser serviles (Slaporb, Teleporb, Emolga type creature, Ophideon).
* Create 3 more greater serviles (One is a knight, another is a griffin, and another is a clay golem like entity)
* Recreate the T Rex for this system.
* Create dough type monster.
* Create a proper Terrasque, but still make it a deadly melee creature which is difficult to deal with by magic. Will have a softspot for non-combatants.
* Create the Wekowyrd, an Everforming Eldritch Horror capable of mutating or regenerating in battle. Doing so will force counterspell checks out to a great distance against anyone casting a spell. Its counterspell bonus is equal to its current HP and its current wounds. A possible mutation of it is to increase HP.
* Create a Knemui. Mucousy illusion casting goblins that cause mischief. They are usually invisible but can be seen through a variety of strange methods (Squirting lemon juice in your eyes, the light of a fire which is cooking food, chewing on a piece of birch bark, holding a hazelnut, covering yourself in lamp oil, holding your breath under water evwn if you can breath underwater, casting a spell known by the knemui, or are within magical light). They can be pacified by giving them a gift given to you in celebration of your bithday, a wedding, a fine piece of mechanical art, or inviting them to a feast set for them.
* Make some Kaiju type monsters.

Make the failed alchemical cycle:  
* Massaconfusar. A being composed of jet black solids linked by a thick smoke. It consumes matter.
* Ablutior. A vaporous white entity which affeccs those around it psychically.
* Citrinitar. An ooze of bright yellow which glows dimly. It can transmute metals. It is attracted to sources of magic, but is highly resistant to them. It is toxic to life.
* Rubedooze. A red liquid which consumes matter and can be shaped by the effects of magic.

Classes, Done:  
**A**canist  (Intelligence caster)  
**A**ssassin (Backstab)  
**B**ard (Informed folks with bonuses against certain creatures and spell types, does not add new spell casting method but does provide some protection against spells)  
**B**erserk (rage wielders)  
**C**leric  (preistly sort that uses ritual magic and prayer, uses [Empy] for casting)  
**E**voker  (ki blast pew pew) *although Super Techniques need to be developed*  
**M**agi (can use spell points to cast spells, uses Will for casting)  
**M**onk (has auras and can be either a martial artist or a support class. Will have an aura or two, but gains features based on monastic order.) *Could still use a few more orders*  
**P**aragon  (gives commands to allies)  
**R**ogue  (has some skill bonuses and luck. A customizable class.)  
**S**orcerer (A Fort based spellcaster who takes on exhaustion for increased spell casting and or spell power)  
**W**arrior  (Full blown fighter)  

Non-Canon Classes, Done:  
**I**nvoker  (Akin to how d2 handled summoning for Druid and Necromancer, a support class that brings their battle buddies. Good for solo adventures. Potentially able to break the game and bog down combat.)  
**J**ester  (a sort of buff and debuff support role that can use skills in new ways)  
**M**ystic  (Has a set of evolving powers from their patron, chooses casting attribute but has an altered feature based on this. Can "burn" attributes to boost spell checks.)  

###### Non-Canon classes are intended to be fully fleshed out and balanced classes, but many will not want them in their campaigns.

Possible classes to do:  
**?**?*?* (A class which can potentially induce tension upon itself and others as a result of their unorthodox or unnatural method of performing magic. Might instead make a species which does this or n alternative magic option for mystics)  
Ranger? (Lots of folks like the idea of the ranger but trying to balance it right could be tough, at least to balance it without stepping on the toes of other classess)
*?**?**?* (A class inspired by old martial arts movie choreography, which gets certain benefits while disadvantaged)

##### What is the difference between a playable species and a non-playable creature?
To be playable, the creature (or rather species) must meet the following criteria.  
* It must not be mindless.
* It must seem distinctive from other species.
* It must be able to be somewhat balanced coompared to other species.
* Members of the species must be capable of being cognisent of the difference between instincts and morality and able to create and operate by morality systems other than its own innate instincts.
