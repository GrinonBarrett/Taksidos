###### Don't mind this too much.

* Make a whole file for books as loot.
* Add 120-170 more creatures, mundane and fantastic, to ensure folks have a strong base to draw from. This will include several mundane real world creatures.
* Add the alchemy system, but not *that* one that gets abused in every game I introduce it into.
* Finish the languages, pantheons, and a few (3-5) adventure sites.
* Put together a little guide to help new narrators.
* ~~Contemplate division of some rules into Basic and Advanced rules.~~
* Create a set of example Rites for narrators to have as a resource.

#### Rules will be reorganized into Basic and Advanced rules!
It just might take a while.

* Create a basic document that the unenfranchised can actually read. One that walks a player through all the basics, lets them make a manfolk character of a few classes, and ibncludes all items afrom the core rules and basic spells. The goal is for a narrator to be able to hand it to a player and them not be overwhelmed (see below note).
* Create a Western World companion to the above mentioned basic book that adds a bunch of species from the west (the ones that don't sound greek for the most part, lol) and some adventure zones (oh yeah, that'll be a thing I suppose).
* Create an Eastern Empires companion to the above mentioned basic book that adds a bunch of species from the east and some adventure sites.
* Create the license by which others can actually use or potentially contribute in a manner that provides futureproof protections for myself and anyone else using the system for derivitive works.
* Character Sheets?! Seriously, why is this such a daunting task to get right.
