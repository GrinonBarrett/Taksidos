###### Don't mind this too much.

* Make a whole file for books as loot.
* Add 140-190 more creatures, mundane and fantastic, to ensure folks have a strong base to draw from.
* Add the alchemy system, but not *that* one that gets abused in every game I introduce it into.
* Finish the languages, pantheons, and a few (3-5) adventure sites.
* Put together a little guide to help new narrators.
* Contemplate division of some rules into Basic and Advanced rules.
